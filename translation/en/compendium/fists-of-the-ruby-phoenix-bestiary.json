Yet, far from the picturesque feline companions they appear to be, angoyangs are actually terrifying beasts capable of peeling back the fleshy layers of their face to reveal a mass of long, toothed tentacles.</p>\n<p>Although most cats instinctively avoid areas where angoyangs roam, the unlucky felines who do encounter this creature are invariably entangled in the monster's toothy tentacles and devoured. In cities and towns where angoyangs reside, cat owners may find that their beloved pets have gone missing only to soon have a fluffy black-and-white cat coincidentally appear at their doorstep, looking up at them with wide eyes and mewing adorably. Angoyangs almost never attack their caretakers, who they see as loyal servants that feed, clean up after, and pamper them, and the creatures protect the people in their household from any would-be intruders. However, a caretaker who mistreats or neglects their angoyang ward is often met with a grisly fate. More than one coroner or gravedigger has inadvertently inherited an angoyang after being assigned to clean up the mutilated remains of a previous \"owner.\"</p>",

Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception.

When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time.

The thick layer of mucus that naturally coats the monitors' scaly skin makes it difficult for most other creatures to get too close, let alone prey upon the lizard.</p>\n<p>Caustic monitors also use their corrosive biological features to their hunting advantage, particularly by expelling the acidic contents of their stomach at prey. Even when not making use of their acid, caustic monitors can be deadly predators: They grab onto smaller creatures using their powerful forelimb muscles and are remarkably agile, considering their size and weight.</p>\n<p>Most caustic monitors live among rocky terrain such as pebble beaches, natural caves, and along sandy river shoals. A caustic monitor's mucus corrodes only flesh, so its den is safe from damage, but corroded plant life near a cave is a telltale sign that a caustic monitor lives nearby.
