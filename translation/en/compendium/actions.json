The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can't continue at the task. Your reputation suffers, potentially making it difficult for you to find rewarding jobs in that community in the future.</p>\n<section class=\"sample-tasks\">\n<h2>Sample Earn Income Tasks</h2>\n<p>These examples use Alcohol Lore to work in a bar or Legal Lore to perform legal work.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trained</strong> bartend, do legal research</li>\n<li><strong>Expert</strong> curate drink selection, present minor court cases</li>\n<li><strong>Master</strong> run a large brewery, present important court cases</li>\n<li><strong>Legendary</strong> run an international brewing franchise, present a case in Hell's courts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Crafting Goods for the Market [Crafting]</h2>\n<p>Using Crafting, you can work at producing common items for the market. It's usually easy to find work making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement's level.</p>\n<p>Higher-level tasks represent special commissions, which might require you to Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full Price. These opportunities don't occur as often and might have special requirementsâ€”or serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Practicing a Trade [Lore]</h2>\n<p>You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there's high demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks are available if you're attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to earn income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant's scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Staging a Performance [Performance]</h2>\n<p>You perform for an audience to make money. The available audiences determine the level of your task, since more discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level.</p>\n<p>Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ending or Interrupting Tasks</h2>\n<p>When a task you're doing is complete, or if you stop in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance, if you quit your job working at the docks, you'll need to find another place of employment instead of picking up where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of downtime looking for leads on new jobs.</p>\n<p>However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or event that wouldn't prevent you from returning to the old job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off, assuming the task hasn't been completed by others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking, if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you can't try for a better one by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed during the breakâ€”usually because you leveled up while adventuringâ€”you can attempt a new check.</p>\n</section>"

To Grow an item, you must meet the following requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The item is your level or lower. An item that doesn't list a level is level 0. If the item is 9th level or higher, you must be a master in Crafting, and if it's 16th or higher, you must be legendary.</li>\n<li>You have the formula for the item; see Getting Formulas for more information.</li>\n<li>You have an appropriate set of tools for growing the item. While cultivation and gardening tools are typical for plants, you might also use a different technique that requires a different set of tools. For instance, if you play music to help your plants grow, you might use a musical instrument instead.</li>\n<li>You must supply special fertilizers or other magical nutrients worth at least half the item's Price. You always expend at least that quantity of fertilizers and magical nutrients when you Grow successfully. If you're in a settlement, you can usually spend currency to get the amount of magical nutrients you need, except in the case of rarer precious materials. You can also bring them with you in advance or forage for them with a skill like Herbalism Lore, gaining an amount of value based on the rules for @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Earn Income}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must spend 4 days at work, at which point you attempt a Crafting check. The GM determines the DC to Grow the item based on its level, rarity, and other circumstances. Depending on the specifics of the type of item, it might be easier to Grow than it is to Craft, or vice versa; typically, the GM can represent that by making an easy or hard DC adjustment.</p>\n<p>If your attempt to create the item is successful, you expend the fertilizers and other magical nutrients you supplied. You can pay the remaining portion of the item's Price in additional growth accelerants to complete the item immediately, or you can spend additional downtime days cultivating the item. For each additional day taken, reduce the value of the accelerants you need to complete the item. This amount is determined using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j]{Income Earned} table, based on your proficiency rank in Crafting and using your own level instead of a task level. After any of these downtime days, you can complete the item by spending the remaining portion of its Price in accelerants. If the downtime days you spend are interrupted, you can return to finish the item later, continuing where you left off.</p>\n<p>You also have the option to allow the item to grow mostly untended, only stopping to supervise it occasionally, though the pace is much slower without your direct intervention. At the end of each season in which you spent at least 1 day of downtime to Grow the item, roll an additional Crafting check and reduce the value of accelerants you need to expend to complete the item by the corresponding amount.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Your attempt is successful. Each additional day spent Growing reduces the materials needed to complete the item by an amount based on your level + 1 and your proficiency rank in Crafting.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> Your attempt is successful.

      "description": "<p>Retraining offers a way to alter your character choices, which is helpful when you want to take your character in a new direction or change decisions that didn't meet your expectations. You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or attribute modifiers. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor. Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, witch can retrain their patron only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't replace a skill feat you chose at 2nd level for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<h3>Feats</h3>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you selected during character creation.</p>\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard schoolâ€”it is always at least a month.</p>"
