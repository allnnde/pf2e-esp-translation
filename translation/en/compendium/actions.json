On a success, the examiner knows the document is a forgery. On a failure, they think the document is genuine and can't try again unless they get a new reason to be suspicious of the document.

It's usually easy to find work making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement's level.</p>\n<p>Higher-level tasks represent special commissions, which might require you to Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full Price. These opportunities don't occur as often and might have special requirements—or serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Practicing a Trade [Lore]</h2>\n<p>You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This is most effective for Lore specialties like business, law, or mining, where there's high demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks are available if you're attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like an enercycle to conduct deliveries in a busy city or a fashionable suit to attend a meeting with corporate clients.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Staging a Performance [Performance]</h2>\n<p>You perform for an audience to make money. The available audiences determine the level of your task, since more discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience in a seedy bar is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of fellow musicians with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for wealthy clients, fashionistas, and interstellar dignitaries are increasingly higher level.</p>\n<p>Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with rave reviews or downvotes.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ending or Interrupting Tasks</h2>\n<p>When a task you're doing is complete, or if you stop in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance, if you quit your job working at the space docks, you'll need to find another place of employment instead of picking up where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of downtime looking for leads on new jobs.</p>\n<p>However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or event that wouldn't prevent you from returning to the old job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off, assuming the task hasn't been completed by others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking, if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you can't try for a better one by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed during the break—usually because you leveled up while adventuring—you can attempt a new check.</p>\n</section>"

You can retrain feats, skills, and some selectable class features. You can't retrain your ancestry, heritage, background, class, or attribute modifiers. You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor. Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, witch can retrain their patron only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't replace a skill feat you chose at 2nd level for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<h3>Feats</h3>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<h3>Skills</h3>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you selected during character creation.</p>\n<h3>Class Features</h3>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead. Some, like changing a spell in your spell repertoire, take a week. The GM will tell you how long it takes to retrain larger choices like a druid order or a wizard school—it is always at least a month.</p>"
