They range in dimensions and quality, but at the end of the day, they're just a means of conveniently carrying and spending money. Usage of these devices is determined by the owner, and a credstick can accept or spend funds with as simple an action as tapping it near a suitable banking device. When more rigorous security is necessary, they can require audio or biometric imprints in order to activate. Some advanced credsticks even have a magical component that might require a mental password or the recitation of a specific spell to access stored funds.</p>\n<p>Credsticks aren't gateways to the entirety of one's wealth, and larger stores of credits are often kept secured in banks, personal vaults, or secure databases. Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced. Adventurers and common citizens alike often keep a credstick on their person to handle any purchases they might be called upon to make, while also only keeping just enough credits on them that losing the credstick wouldn't result in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Individuals in the Pact Worlds often carry credsticks, and other civilizations that interact with the Pact often turn local funds into credits and thus carry them to spend their converted currency. Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"

Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced.

If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"

They range in dimensions and quality, but at the end of the day, they're just a means of conveniently carrying and spending money. Usage of these devices is determined by the owner, and a credstick can accept or spend funds with as simple an action as tapping it near a suitable banking device. When more rigorous security is necessary, they can require audio or biometric imprints in order to activate. Some advanced credsticks even have a magical component that might require a mental password or the recitation of a specific spell to access stored funds.</p>\n<p>Credsticks aren't gateways to the entirety of one's wealth, and larger stores of credits are often kept secured in banks, personal vaults, or secure databases. Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced. Adventurers and common citizens alike often keep a credstick on their person to handle any purchases they might be called upon to make, while also only keeping just enough credits on them that losing the credstick wouldn't result in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Individuals in the Pact Worlds often carry credsticks, and other civilizations that interact with the Pact often turn local funds into credits and thus carry them to spend their converted currency. Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"

Usage of these devices is determined by the owner, and a credstick can accept or spend funds with as simple an action as tapping it near a suitable banking device. When more rigorous security is necessary, they can require audio or biometric imprints in order to activate. Some advanced credsticks even have a magical component that might require a mental password or the recitation of a specific spell to access stored funds.</p>\n<p>Credsticks aren't gateways to the entirety of one's wealth, and larger stores of credits are often kept secured in banks, personal vaults, or secure databases. Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced. Adventurers and common citizens alike often keep a credstick on their person to handle any purchases they might be called upon to make, while also only keeping just enough credits on them that losing the credstick wouldn't result in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Individuals in the Pact Worlds often carry credsticks, and other civilizations that interact with the Pact often turn local funds into credits and thus carry them to spend their converted currency. Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"

As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, depending on which you chose for your key attribute.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Warp Spells</h3>\n<p>You can create powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is active, and you automatically Sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p>\n<p>You learn warp spells based on your paradox.</p>"

As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, depending on which you chose for your key attribute.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Warp Spells</h3>\n<p>You can create powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is active, and you automatically Sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p>\n<p>You learn warp spells based on your paradox.</p>"

Usage of these devices is determined by the owner, and a credstick can accept or spend funds with as simple an action as tapping it near a suitable banking device.

Some advanced credsticks even have a magical component that might require a mental password or the recitation of a specific spell to access stored funds.</p>\n<p>Credsticks aren't gateways to the entirety of one's wealth, and larger stores of credits are often kept secured in banks, personal vaults, or secure databases. Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced. Adventurers and common citizens alike often keep a credstick on their person to handle any purchases they might be called upon to make, while also only keeping just enough credits on them that losing the credstick wouldn't result in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Individuals in the Pact Worlds often carry credsticks, and other civilizations that interact with the Pact often turn local funds into credits and thus carry them to spend their converted currency. Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"

          "description": "<p>Your paradox grants you magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma or Intelligence modifier, depending on which you chose for your key attribute.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h3>Warp Spells</h3>\n<p>You can create powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is active, and you automatically Sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p>\n<p>You learn warp spells based on your paradox.</p>"

They range in dimensions and quality, but at the end of the day, they're just a means of conveniently carrying and spending money. Usage of these devices is determined by the owner, and a credstick can accept or spend funds with as simple an action as tapping it near a suitable banking device. When more rigorous security is necessary, they can require audio or biometric imprints in order to activate. Some advanced credsticks even have a magical component that might require a mental password or the recitation of a specific spell to access stored funds.</p>\n<p>Credsticks aren't gateways to the entirety of one's wealth, and larger stores of credits are often kept secured in banks, personal vaults, or secure databases. Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced. Adventurers and common citizens alike often keep a credstick on their person to handle any purchases they might be called upon to make, while also only keeping just enough credits on them that losing the credstick wouldn't result in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p>Individuals in the Pact Worlds often carry credsticks, and other civilizations that interact with the Pact often turn local funds into credits and thus carry them to spend their converted currency. Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"
