          "description": "<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can construct spells with academic rigor by shaping arcane magic. You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to and learn via Learn a Spell.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>\n<h2>Spellbook</h2>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells.

Your familiar starts off knowing 10 cantrips, five 1st-rank spells, and one additional spell determined by your patron's initial lesson. You choose these spells from the common spells of the tradition determined by your patron or from other spells of that tradition you gain access to. Each time you gain a level, your patron teaches your familiar two new spells of any rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. Feats can also grant your familiar additional spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning Spells:</strong> Your familiar can learn new spells independently of your patron. It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity. You and your familiar can use the Learn a Spell activity to teach your familiar a spell from another witch's familiar. Both familiars must be present for the entirety of the activity, the spell must be on your spellcasting tradition's spell list, and you must pay the usual cost for that activity, typically in the form of an offering to the other familiar's patron. You can't prepare spells from another witch's familiar.</p>\n<p><strong>Undying:</strong> If your familiar dies, your patron replaces it during your next daily preparations. The new familiar might be a duplicate or reincarnation of your former familiar or a new entity altogether, but it knows the same spells your former familiar knew regardless. Your familiar's death doesn't affect any spells you have already prepared.</p>"

A hex is a spell shaped by your patron and sent to you through your familiar, rather than an ability you use directly. Your patron expects you to advance its interests and does not take kindly to repeated requests for aid; as such, you can use only one hex each turn, and any attempts to use a second hex on that turn fail and the actions are lost.</p>\n<p>Hex spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to commune with your familiar.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn your choice of the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.aq1yonHeYpbaj3XI]{Patron's Puppet} hex or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.rMOI8JFJ0nT2mrCF]{Phase Familiar} hex, which let you command your familiar or defend it from harm, respectively. You learn most other hexes from witch lessons.</p>\n<h2>Hex Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Hex cantrips are special hexes that don't cost Focus Points, so you can cast them as often as you like, though you can still use only one hex each round. Hex cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose with witch spellcasting and aren't counted toward your prepared cantrips.</p>\n<p>You gain a hex cantrip determined by your choice of patron.</p>"

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of your patron's tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witch, when you cast spells, your incantations might rhyme, your gestures might be as simple as an ominous pointing finger or a complex folk sign, and your familiar might even echo your words or movements slightly as your patron's magic surges.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells your familiar knows. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a witch, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Witch Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd-rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p>\n<h2>Cantrips</h2>\n<p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witch spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witch, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witch, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"

It can learn any spell on your tradition's spell list by physically consuming a written version of that spell over the course of 1 hour. This can be a scroll of that spell, or you can prepare a written version using the Learn a Spell exploration activity.

The more cursebound abilities you use, the more your curse worsens, but you might gain divine benefits even as it tightens its grip on your soul.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse is expressed using the cursebound condition, a unique condition that affects only oracles. Immediately after the first time you use a cursebound ability, you become cursebound 1, and if you use a cursebound ability while you are already cursebound, you increase the value of your cursebound condition by 1 after the ability resolves. At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4. Once saturated in divine power, your soul can't absorb any more, and so you can't use a cursebound ability if you are already at your maximum cursebound condition.</p>\n<p>Your oracular curse lists the specific effects of being cursebound, which are cumulative as your curse progresses. You remain cursebound until you Refocus, which reduces your cursebound condition by 1 in addition to restoring a Focus Point. As your curse is a direct result of divine power, you cannot mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your curse or any ability with the cursebound trait by any means other than Refocusing. For example, if a cursebound effect makes creatures @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{Sure Strike} (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SUKaxVZW2TlM8lu0]{Cleanse Affliction} and similar abilities don't affect your curse at all.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a cursebound oracle feat determined by your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.PRJYLksQEwT39bTl]{Mystery}, and you can learn additional cursebound abilities through oracle feats.</p><hr /><h3>The Cursebound Condition</h3><p>Your oracular curse is constricting around you as you receive divine punishment after drawing too deeply on your mystery's powers.

For example, casting a spell to create undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list.

Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you're using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"

Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"

The most common deities in Pathfinder appear on pages 35–39 of Player Core, along with their edicts, areas of concern, and the benefits you get for being a devotee of that deity. Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"

The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots.

The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have.

          "description": "<h2>Sorcerer Spellcasting</h2><p>Your bloodline provides you with incredible magical power. You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. The tradition from which your spells come is determined by your bloodline. As a sorcerer, you draw your power from within, and the gestures and incantations you use to shape your power might evoke the nature of your bloodline. For instance, a sorcerer with a demonic bloodline might chant guttural fiendish phrases or make brief curt gestures to cast a spell.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a sorcerer, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Sorcerer Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast it in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of sorcerer spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level sorcerer, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"12\">* The bloodline paragon class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table>"

At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it.

You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step.

This can't move the creature into the air.

          "name": "Impulses",
          "description": "<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>"

At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>"

        "feat->Impulses": {
          "name": "Impulses",
          "description": "<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element. Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>"

You can choose either a single gate (one element) or dual gate (two elements) at 1st level.</p>\n<p>When selecting an element for your kinetic gate, you can pick from six elements - air, earth, fire metal, water, and wood. Elements you can channel are referred to as your kinetic elements. Your kinetic elements function even in environments where they normally wouldn't. For example, you could use fire actions underwater even though that's normally not possible, and you could create air in a vacuum.</p>\n<p>Your kinetic gate gives you impulse feats, magical actions that let you shape and control your elements in awesome ways. You can select more impulse feats using your kineticist class feats, as described under Impulses. At higher levels, the gate's threshold class feature gives you more impulse feats and lets you choose whether to improve with one element or access new kinetic elements.</p>\n<h3><strong>Single Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate links to a single elemental plane, starting you with a single element but giving you greater power with it. Choose one element to be your kinetic element, and select two 1st-level impulse feats that have that element's trait.</p>\n<p>In addition, you gain an impulse junction, a benefit that occurs when you use an impulse of the chosen element that takes 2 actions or more. This happens before the other effects of the impulse, unless noted otherwise. You can gain only one impulse junction per round; they are described in full below.</p>\n<p><strong>Air</strong> Before or after the other effects of the impulse, you can either Stride up to half your Speed or Step. If you have a fly Speed, you can Fly up to half your fly Speed instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Earth</strong> Fragments of stone float around you, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Fire</strong> Increase the damage die size of fire damage dealt by the impulse by one step.</p>\n<p><strong>Metal</strong> Choose acid, electricity, or piercing. Until the start of your next turn, each time a creature touches you or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or nonreach melee weapon, it takes damage of the chosen type equal to half your level (minimum 1 damage).</p>\n<p><strong>Water</strong> After the impulse's other effects, you can move one creature targeted by the impulse or in its area 5 feet in any direction, or 10 feet if it's in a body of water. This can't move the creature into the air. You can choose only a creature that's willing to be moved, that failed its save against the impulse, or that you succeeded at an impulse attack roll against.</p>\n<p><strong>Wood</strong> You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last until the start of your next turn.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dual Gate</strong></h3>\n<p>Your kinetic gate is a harmonious conduit between two planes, allowing you to combine their elements to give you a versatile set of abilities. Select two elements to be your kinetic elements. Then, select two 1st-level impulse feats, one with the trait of the first element and one with the trait of the other.</p>"

        "feat->Impulses": {
          "name": "Impulses",
          "description": "<p>An impulse is a special type of magical action available to kineticists, allowing them to wield or shape their element into diverse and powerful forms. To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs.

Though each element has its own strengths and weaknesses, the basic principles to using them are the same. You can customize the appearance of your Elemental Blast and can even choose a different form each time you use the impulse.</p>\n<h3><strong>Base Kinesis</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.nTBrvt2b9wngyr0i]{Base Kinesis} impulse lets you perform simple alterations to an element.</p>"
