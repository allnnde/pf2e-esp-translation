In addition, you can detect specific ongoing disturbances to the natural world—such as industrial mining or a fire in a particular valley. You can sense the distance and direction of the disturbance and gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against hazards created by this disturbance.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As a critical success, but you can only sense disturbances happening on a massive scale (such as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, or planetwide pollution) and the direction to it.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You diagnose the planet's health but don't identify any disturbances.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Special</strong> You can take this feat if you have the mystic multiclass archetype dedication feat even if you haven't taken two additional mystic feats. Mystic archetype feats count as xenodruid feats, and vice-versa, for purposes of completing the archetypes.</p>",
