A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic-a thing that can be created only by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about.</p>\n<p>Tupilaqs' animating energies aren't tied to their original functions, and the creatures typically long outlast their creators, their victims, and often any who recall the reason for their creation. They might fall into a sort of hibernation once they've achieved immediate vengeance, but they frequently reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. Summoned tupilaqs, hauled unceremoniously from their vengeance, become near-frenzied combatants, unleashing every offensive ability in their arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to their true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about tupilaqs employing spells that might be turned against their summoners, such as a fireball spell \"accidentally\" placed such that it incinerates the spellcaster and returns these creatures from whence they came.</p>",

While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal's attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth-though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter-at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers' noises-studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.</p>\n<p>Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv.

They flourish most in high altitudes and cold climates, where they survive by dazzling small prey with their iridescent blossoms before crushing them to death with impossibly strong tendrils. The blood and decomposing flesh of their prey seep into the ground like fertilizer for glimmervines' roots to absorb as nutrients. Because scarps and gulleys caked with gore tend to deter future victims, glimmervines instinctively know not to linger in one spot for long.</p>\n<p>Glimmervines are mostly dormant during the day. Clinging to the sides of mountains and cliffs, they're easily mistaken for mundane climbing plants such as ivy or morning glory. When night falls, though, glimmervines' spectacular reflective flowers make their entrancing nature plain for all to see.</p>\n<p>Glimmervines are closely related to assassin vines, who employ similar ambush tactics and feeding behaviors, but the former is easily discernible by the shiny white blooms in place of an assassin vine's small red berries. These petals are coated with iridescent veins that absorb sunlight during the day and give off an eerie yet beautiful glow at night. The glistening patina attracts pollinating insects.</p>\n<p>On their own, glimmervines don't pose much of a threat to most creatures. Though its root-based sensory organs are formidable in close proximity, a glimmervine can't sense creatures farther than 60 feet away, making escape as easy as getting out of range of their slow movement. The true danger of these plants comes from glimmervine thickets—dense patches of glimmervines that can entangle entire hillsides or ravines. Woe be unto a hapless traveler caught in the midst of a glimmervine thicket at sundown.</p>",

As they imparted their wisdom, these spirit guides took physical forms, becoming the wild animals that exist today.

Though this process is invaluable, it's also a vulnerability—one that the immolis has evolved to exploit.</p>\n<p>Immolises are psychic predators found all across Castrovel, especially underground and in cool environs. Mostly blind, they hunt by sensing the body heat of other creatures. When an immolis acquires a target, it focuses its innate psychic energies in an invisible beam aimed at its prey. The sudden influx of energy causes the target's metabolism to accelerate rapidly, spurring the creature's body to produce energy at a dangerous rate. This sudden rush of heat literally cooks the creature internally—innards burst, blood boils, and fat catches fire. The end result isn't just warm food, but a meal roasted to morbid perfection.</p>\n<p>An immolis's basic shape resembles that of a spidery, spindly frog covered in delicate scales. The head has a simian muzzle, the lips of which pull back to reveal a squid-like beak. Above the mouth, the creature has three pairs of nostrils, which fare and chuff as the creature hunts. Though they walk with a hunch, immolises climb with shocking speed.</p>\n<p>Unlike many other pyro-predators, immolises have a deep and paradoxical fear of fire, perhaps because they know how easily any flesh—their own included—can blacken and burn. As a result, they prefer to lair near water. This presents its own problem, however, as their heat sense is easily disrupted by creatures taking steps to hide their heat signatures, such as submerging themselves in water or snow. While intelligent enough to communicate and band together with others of their kind, immolises view all other species as either prey or threats and have as little interest in cultural exchange as in personal possessions.

An ocluai's gray body resembles that of a featherless owl with a serrated beak, the legs of a monkey, and oversized eye sockets full of shadow. The field of unnatural darkness that surrounds an ocluai disorients most creatures; while other gorgas are quick to move in for the kill, ocluais love to perch on a low branch or lintel and watch with their blank expressions as prey succumbs to panic. Though capable fighters, ocluais prefer to hang back and slash at those whose frantic fight brings them within range, letting their prey's own terror drive them over cliffs or bring them to their knees.</p>\n<p>Ocluais understand several languages but rarely communicate with non-fey. When they do, their communication takes the form of unsettling telepathic images projected directly into the other party's mind as the ocluai holds their gaze.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Gorgas are fey embodiments of diurnal creatures' fear of the dark. Beings of shadow and hunger, they love to prey upon light-loving creatures. Many different kinds of gorgas exist, and each embodies a different facet of the night's countless terrors.</p>\n<p>Gorgas are common in the First World realm of Nighthold, where they once served the mysterious Count Ranalc. After Ranalc's disappearance, the gorgas quickly lost what little compassion they had, scattered into small bands led by their strongest members, and began hunting any fey they could find. All gorgas carry shrouds of shadow within them, and most find daylight unpleasant, tending to remain within Nighthold's perpetual gloom or hole up in caverns or deep forests until night falls. Their bizarre eyes—hollow pools of magical shadow—allow them to see even in magical darkness.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>An animate dream coalesces from centuries of stray fragments of reverie and dream left behind as slumbering minds drift through the Dimension of Dreams. In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",
