For the duration of the spell, either creature can manipulate fate once on each of its turns. This allows it to either roll twice and take the higher result on an attack roll or skill check it attempts against its opponent (a fortune effect) or force the opponent to roll twice on a saving throw against one of its abilities and take the lower result (a misfortune effect). The GM might decide that other genres of games exist that add additional rules or subsystems to resolving the spell. The spell ends if either target becomes unable to act or if they both agree to cease hostilities. Any results of the game, such as damage or conditions, persist after the game is over. If a player dies in this game, they die in real life.</li>\n<li>If you cast this spell targeting one enemy, the target enters a PvE or puzzle game that traps them until they can complete the game.

Teleportation magic doesn't help the creature escape unless the magic can transport someone into or out of a virtual space. When the spell ends, either because the target escaped or the duration ran out, the target returns to the space it occupied when it was digitized, or to the nearest space if the original is now filled.
