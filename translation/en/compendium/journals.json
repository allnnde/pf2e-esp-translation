          "text": "<p><em>Anadi people are reclusive, sapient spiders who hail from the jungles of southern Garund. Though they act in many ways like natural-born shapeshifters, their twin forms actually stem from carefully developed magic.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a communal and peaceful people, anadi ancestors endeavored to establish trade with the neighbors of ttheir homeland. However, these anadi soon learned that most others found their appearance to be extremely objectionable. Wishing to avoid conflict, ancient anadi retreated into isolation until they could find a solution. The answer came when their greatest scholars innovated a fusion of transmutation and illusion magic that allowed them to assume a humanoid form. The technique was developed, perfected, and eventually taught to the overwhelming majority of anadi.</p>\n<p>Early efforts with their new approach to diplomacy have yielded much better results, though sporadic contact means that some outsiders whisper false legends about anadi, such as claims that they are humans who transform into monstrous spiders at moonrise. Even contemporary explorers have reported anadi as human-spider hybrids. The anadi people of the current day strive to slowly but surely create a world where they no longer need to hide their true nature.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Only reveal your true form to people who have earned your trust.</li>\n<li>Openly express sympathy for misrepresented and unfairly stigmatized cultures.</li>\n<li>Provide for those you hold dear and defend them from danger without hesitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your willingness to seek nonviolent solutions to complicated problems.</li>\n<li>Have a strong reaction to seeing your natural form.</li>\n<li>Assume you have an affinity for druidic magic, given your ability to transform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Anadi in their true form resemble human-sized spiders with a variety of colorations. Some tones look simple or muted while other remain striking and vibrant, with most patterns inherited from an anadi's parentage. A typical anadi measures five feet in length from their front legs to their rear legs when standing comfortably.</p>\n<p>All anadi possesses the ability to transform into a human guise. This form can resemble any human ethnicity, but it's usually one that blends in with the region of an anadi's hatching. Anadi reach physical maturity after 13 years, going through multiple phases of molting along the way. A typical anadi lives to be about 80 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Anadi live in a communal society, sharing peaceful lives farming mushrooms or weaving warm blankets. Their culture places great value on cooperation and mutual respect. Due to this cultural upbringing, anadi often have issues facing severe conflict and often come off to other ancestries as very shy. Their history of dealing with arachnophobia in other peoples-which anadi understand is often instinctual and very difficult to control-likewise means that anadi do their best to be accommodating and comforting, even in situations that aren't necessarily fair to them.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The cooperative nature of anadi society and their dislike of violence means many anadi lean toward good alignments. They're more often neutral than chaotic or lawful, though the latter aren't unheard of.</p>\n<p>Legends say Grandmother Spider rescued anadi people from servitude and brought them to Golarion, becoming their patron deity in the process. Her values of mutual care and playful trickery interweave into anadi culture, and even those who don't worship her tell tales of her adventures.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Anadi names are given by the members of the web marriage that raised them. Each parent contributes a single syllable, usually the first, from their own name. Older anadi who feel their identity has settled often take on or are given a phrase-title to honor them as well. Anadi who live among human populations rarely take a cover name, but some might adopt one if their given name strongly contrasts the norm in the local culture.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altava, Anavachti, Strings-On-The-River Inkeelah, Kerialnamu, Maracha, Leaves-Shelter-Her-Feet Naiala, Orvasa, Reloana, Rivuken, Velachamon</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Anadi Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Anadi, Mwangi</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "name": "Android",
          "text": "<p><em>Technological wonders from another world, androids have synthetic bodies and living souls. Their dual nature makes them quick-thinking and calm under pressure, but comfortable in stillness and solitude.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Androids first arrived on Golarion during the Rain of Stars, when an interstellar vessel from the far-off planet of Androffa crash-landed, scattering debris across Numeria. While some android survivors of this crash still walk Golarion today, most were created from the technological pods, known as foundries, that operate sporadically amid the starship's wreckage. Androids birthed from these mechanical wombs possess mature bodies and newborn souls, both organic and synthetic; they emerge knowing only their creators' language and the motor skills necessary for survival. They have no understanding of their surroundings, origin, or purpose. Most learn how to behave through keen observation while wandering Numeria.</p>\n<p>Androids tend to be logical introverts, rational and contemplative. Insatiably curious, with an urge to understand themselves and the world around them, androids place great value on intellectual pursuits. They have difficulty interpreting and expressing emotions, both in themselves and in others, which makes them seem distant and uncaring. While androids can forge emotional bonds, they find it more difficult to connect with non-androids.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that's a synthetic foreigner in a fantastic world, forced to learn the nuances of reality and society through the powers of observation and logic alone, you should play an android.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep your identity a secret, assuming others want to exploit or harm you.</li>\n<li>Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.</li>\n<li>Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you understand how to operate technology and that you can capably communicate with constructs and robots.</li>\n<li>Believe you to be immortal and envy your eternal youth and vigor.</li>\n<li>Think you have no feelings and that you can't form emotional connections with others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Androids were created in humanity's image; thus, foundries produce androids that represent all humankind. Androids display great diversity in coloration and ethnicity, height and body shape, and gender identity. Androids breathe, eat, and sleep like a human, although they're incapable of biological procreation. Their bodies contain microscopic nanites, transported by fluid too watery to be blood, that manage their organic processes. These nanites are controlled through biological circuitry that resembles tattoos and is typically located along an android's hands, forearms, face, or neck. Many androids can harness their nanites to increase their bodies' efficiency, causing the circuitry to glow.</p>\n<p>Androids don't grow old. Instead, their organic appearance becomes less convincing over time, causing them to look more artificial. After a century, most androids feel their time coming to an end and willingly release their souls to the Boneyard to face Pharasma's judgment. Their bodies then shut down, entering a lifeless hibernation as their nanites begin restoration protocol and reset their synthetic bodies to their original manufactured state. After a few weeks, a new soul enters the android's form, triggering reinitialization. This process, called Renewal, is an event to be celebrated, akin to bearing a child. Those that die by violence can't Renew, so androids go to great lengths to protect themselves and their brethren from harm.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Androids have a history of being exploited, enslaved, and destroyed by their Numerian neighbors, so they hide in order to survive. Most choose to keep their ancestry secret by integrating into human society or by adapting to a nomadic lifestyle. Some androids eschew humanity to live among their kind. Such groups often remain small by necessity; while a pair of androids can avoid danger through careful secrecy, large groups attract too much attention.</p>\n<p>Android communities are efficient and highly organized. Each citizen understands their role and takes pride in filling it effectively. Debates and lectures frequently occur, as androids seek to understand themselves and their world through education and inquiry. These insular and secretive enclaves relocate when discovered.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most androids are neutral. They care for their own safety and that of their companions and their kind. Androids interested in religion usually worship Casandalee or Brigh, goddesses that unite invention and life. Other popular deities include Desna, Irori, and Gozreh.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Androids adopt the naming conventions of their surrounding societies, while those raised among their own kind instead select a single name that utilizes Androffan phonology. Occasionally, such androids add a numerical designation to their names, denoting how many generations their body has hosted life as a kind of homage to their bloodline.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Anati, Daniv, Era-4, Feralia, Gelegor, Ilgos-5, Koresh, Oris, Prime, Urdun, Verity-3, Ymry</p>\n<h2>Android Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Androffan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Athamaru": {
          "name": "Athamaru",
          "text": "<p>Athamarus are fish-like humanoids who form tight-knit undersea communities. In small settlements, they engage in the subsistence farming of seaweed, train eels to serve as mounts, and create elaborate works of coral art. Their interactions with other aquatic ancestries are strained, as athamarus have suffered mistreatment at their hands. However, they remain curious about potential connections and what new opportunities may offer.</p>\n<p>Athamarus define themselves by their connections to the world around them. They live in communal settings among coral reefs and aquatic companion creatures that encourage large families and friend groups. Athamaru settlements established near river or sea trade routes usually maintain strong relationships with the sailors who regularly pass by, exchanging coral jewelry or information about nearby sea routes for surface goods, especially root foods like tubers, yams, and other vegetables, which they see as delicacies.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who values community and survives the sea through effort alone, you should play an athamaru.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Value your community above most everything else.</li>\n<li>Approach strangers with warm curiosity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you're well versed in underwater survival.</li>\n<li>Believe you're to blame for foul smells.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Athamarus have a distinctive appearance that resembles fish. Their brightly colored skin often matches the reefs where they build their communities. Frills, barbels, and crested fins add to their flamboyant appearance. The sheer variety of crest shapes, scale patterns, and fin styles make individuals distinct, even as communities share features. These similarities are often environmentally advantageous, such as scales that allow them to blend into seaweed or longer toes in areas with stony seabeds.</p>\n<p>Outsiders often note that athamarus have a distinctive smell, which comes from pheromones, used for both communication and defense. While the level of control varies, all athamarus can communicate basic emotions chemically, and individual settlements have unique variations to their pheromones that serve as a community fingerprint. Masters of pheromonal expression can communicate complex philosophical concepts purely chemically, occupying a role similar to master singers in other communities.</p>\n<p>Athamarus value natural adornments that blur the lines between body modifications and jewelry. In areas where coral grows, tending reefs and their symbiotic species are highly valued tasks. Some fashion still-living specimens into earrings or cuffs, then gently guide the coral as it continues to grow. These pieces often stay in circulation for generations and are valued as living community history. Other uses of coral include integrating pieces in with the wearer's body in symbiosis, the coral providing nutrients and the athamaru ensuring access to sunlight and quality water.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The largest population of athamarus lives in the underwater nation of Xidao in Tian Xia. There, smaller city-states follow their own government and leaders, though they have vowed to protect one another from the terrors of the deep should the need arise. The largest city-state, Yashabaru, has no direct control over the other settlements, but its leader serves as a figurehead for the region. Outside of Xidao, communities are more isolated and independent, though population centers include the Shackles, a reclusive settlement near Sedeq, and the large gulfs of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The smallest individual athamaru settlements might have only a dozen members, while the largest house hundreds. Athamaru communities connect with other aquatic inhabitants to build strong bonds that improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Animals are integrated into their communities as partners, particularly the domesticated eels that athamarus use as steeds. The eels generally roam freely, and athamarus train mounts from newly hatched elvers they raise.</p>\n<p>Each community consists of genetically related athamarus, typically all born from a single parent. In most settlements, the parent is known as the matriarch and serves as the leader. When this parent nears the end of their life or otherwise stops laying eggs, several athamarus in the community choose to undergo certain physical changes, including an increase in size, to announce their intention to become the next matriarch. The decision to be considered a matriarch isn't taken lightly, as the eventual leadership role is responsible for the community's survival and continuation. Each community selects their next matriarch from these \"hopefuls\" in their own way. Such traditions include democratic elections, trials of knowledge, and contests of physicality involving deep diving or riding untamed wildlife. In Xidao, citystate matriarch candidates must present themselves to the High Matriarch and their council to be judged worthy of completing the transformation.</p>\n<p>Sometimes young adults split off to create new communities, especially if resources become scarce or internal conflict escalates. If a group struggles as they establish a community, their former settlement often agrees to take them back if they agree to respect the extant leadership.</p>\n<p>Other groups have mistreated athamarus in the past, so their communities maintain strong internal bonds. Athamarus consider it less risky to deal with each other first. While the most common activities between them are trade, communities also share information. Warnings about danger flow quickly. Safe opportunities are also shared, such as trustworthy land-dwellers and open markets. Such trust with outsiders, however, is easily lost and hard to regain. Most athamarus would rather flee—sometimes even uprooting an entire community—than risk open hostilities.</p>\n<p>Athamaru names typically consist of three syllables. The first syllable is shared by all members of a generation, and the last two syllables identify an individual. When traveling outside their communities, they introduce themselves by their community name first. Some communities, particularly those in Xidao, break this convention, but those names still maintain a flow and identify athamarus hatched in the same year.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aussandor, Cayiel, Corlena, Mithae, Onteac, Paquotal</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Due to their community-minded nature, athamarus tend to favor beliefs and philosophies that focus on connection and aiding others. They are also aware that they sometimes require protection from the dangers of the sea, so some athamarus take on the roles of staunch guardians or religious figures who plead for intercession from sympathetic gods. Worship within a single community tends to favor one deity, with multiple temples being rare. In the Inner Sea, athamaru settlements typically revere the nature god Gozreh to strengthen their bonds with their surroundings or Erastil for guidance on forming healthy communities. In Tian Xia, the Duke of Thunder Hei Feng's favor is sought as athamarus navigate fickle seasons and politics, while those athamarus who guard the seas against horrors from the deep pray to the triad war gods Srikalis, Sritaming, and Sribaril for unwavering strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>seek out new experiences away from your place of birth, lead your community to a better future</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>betray your community or otherwise knowingly do it harm</p>\n<h2>Athamaru Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet, Swim 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength Wisdom Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Thalassic, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Automaton": {
          "name": "Automaton",
          "text": "<p><em>These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness. Automatons combine technological ingenuity with magical power, creating a blended being wholly unique to Golarion.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Jistka Imperium was the first major human civilization to emerge after Earthfall, arising around the area that would later become Rahadoum and enduring for seven centuries thanks to great advancements in civics and the sciences. However, Jistka's leaders often favored aggressive uses of technology, and early advances paved the way for arrogance, petty infighting, and corruption. The Jistka Imperium's expansionist tendencies and lack of diplomacy earned the Imperium many enemies over the course of its existence. The most notable of these foes was the empire of Ancient Osirion. Osirion's enmity ultimately sealed the Imperium's fate, as they employed clever and depraved magic that proved more than a match for Jistka's legendary golem army, even when the Jistkans began to cut corners and bind fiends into their golems. In a desperate attempt to fight back against internal corruption and external pressures, a cabal of concerned Jistkans formed the Artificer Conclave to develop new technologies to stave off the Imperium's collapse and return Jistka to its former glory. The most successful of these developments were automatons, which the Conclave believed to be the pinnacle of Jistkan constructs-or at least, the last hope for Jistka's salvation. Conclave creators transplanted the mind, life force, and soul of Jistkan individuals into these constructs, creating magical and technological marvels powered by the life energy of the greatest warriors and scholars the organization could recruit. Unfortunately, despite the Conclave's best efforts, the automatons' arrival happened too late to save the already doomed Imperium. The empire collapsed, leaving automatons to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p>The exceptional and forward-thinking construction of automatons means that a fair number remain today, millennia later, scattered to the winds. However, the passage of time has revealed one of automatons' greatest weaknesses: their mortal psyches. Only the strongest willed have managed to retain their memories, sense of self, and lucidity after all this time. As each automaton remains as unique as any living person on Golarion; a given automaton has their own personality, shaped by countless experiences. Most automatons behave reclusively, preferring to avoid others due to fear of attachment or misunderstanding. Even automatons who are more willing to live in the open understand that their unique nature makes them a prime target for hunters, scholars, or worse. Rare is the automaton that lives without the regular occurrence of distrust or worry.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have lived for several centuries and through many significant events.</li>\n<li>Be hesitant to trust others until they've earned it.</li>\n<li>Remember little of your life before becoming an automaton.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a mindless construct when they first see you.</li>\n<li>Assume you have secret knowledge about magic and technology.</li>\n<li>Look upon you with awe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Automatons share a common construction-a blend of magically treated metals and stone. This design allows automatons to withstand the rigors of direct combat and makes them particularly hardy. Their heavy bodies can move just as quickly as other combatants, making automatons intimidating foes. The design of an automaton varies depending on the needs of its role. Most automatons have a basic humanoid shape, though some instead have shapes that closely resemble animals. The majority of automatons have a single eye that glows with a dim, magical light. Each also contains a powerful artifact that both houses its individual soul and uses a combination of life and planar energy for power. These automaton cores are marvels of magical engineering whose method of creation has been lost to time.</p>\n<p>As constructs, automatons typically don't need to breathe, eat, or sleep; however, the body of an automaton needs to vent an imperceivable magical exhaust at a constant rate. This venting process requires breathable air to prevent a buildup of exhaust that can clog the automaton's systems, sometimes to fatal effect. Thus, automatons can still suffocate much like living creatures. Though they don't sleep, automatons require a period of magical recalibration and restoration which stabilizes the energies within their core. Without this process, an automaton core is incapable of fully powering the automaton and they enter an inefficient state (similar to a humanoid who doesn't get 8 hours of sleep).</p>\n<p>Automatons don't age and the design of their cores grants them a seemingly endless power source. Many automatons that exist today are thousands of years old, their bodies as efficient as the day of their creation, even if their minds might have deteriorated with the strain of the ages. Automatons lost over time typically met violent ends. An automaton's body is just as vulnerable to destruction as any other construct, though destroying an automaton core is more difficult. As such, an automaton's soul might remain trapped within its core for years after the destruction of its body. This was the intent of the original creators, who hoped to provide functional immortality. However, in reality, the destruction of the body more often leads to a malfunction, requiring magical intervention such as resurrection magic to restore the automaton completely. In the case of the core's destruction, or if it malfunctions catastrophically enough that it can no longer hold the soul, the core releases the spirit to the River of Souls.</p>\n<p>In some cases, an automaton can learn how to consciously or subconsciously influence its core. These automatons eventually learn how to release their souls from their cores, allowing their souls to move on when they feel they have achieved a satisfying life. This act leaves the automaton as a mindless construct, typically still active but no longer capable of anything but aimless wandering and occasional acts of self-defense.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Due to the disparate fates of automatons, many of them lead solitary lives. There are a few cases of automatons originally designed to work together, such as groups of warriors, who remain as a team and dwell together in hideouts or travel together as wanderers. These groups are few and far between, however, and automaton settlements are even rarer. The only pockets of automatons that begin to resemble settlements typically hide among the ruins of Jistka. These groups can hold dozens of automatons, but any attempts to contact or visit them tend to be fruitless. Such gatherings are especially secretive, and the resident automatons will protect their homes at any cost.</p>\n<p>Automatons are far more likely to encounter other ancestries. Depending on the automaton's personality, this encounter could go a number of ways, ranging from extreme secrecy to open visitation. An automaton's unique appearance makes them stand out regardless of where they're found, but most others look upon them with awe or curiosity rather than fear. Magical constructs aren't an alien concept across Golarion, but many of them are mindless. After making it past the initial shock of a thinking construct, it's often not difficult for most grasp how to engage with an automaton. However, automatons are more likely to find the semblance of an everyday life in large cities like Absalom, Azir, or Quantium. Regardless of where they go, an automaton must remain on the lookout for those who would attempt to take their body for study or to access their core.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The people of the Jistka Imperium saw the aeons of Axis as ideal beings whose behavior was worthy of emulation, so many Jistkans were lawful neutral. Since many automatons contain Jistkan souls, most automatons are lawful neutral, or at least lawful in some capacity. Over the centuries, however, a fair number of automatons have drifted toward neutral alignments as their outlooks change without a primary society or set of ideals upon which to cling. Automatons tend to worship gods of technology or magic like Brigh and Nethys, or various monitor demigods. Worship of Irori and Pharasma are somewhat common among automatons as well. Pharasmin automatons likely learn how to release their souls from their cores, and often choose to do so. Though they are ancient beings from long before the time of Casandalee, a small number of automatons have recognized the new artificial goddess as a kindred spirit.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>An automaton typically keeps the name they had before their transformation into a construct, if they can remember it. Even when other memories fade, memory of their name often remains. As such, many automatons have names with Jistkan origins. Second most common are automatons who had to give themselves a new name, as they lost their memories of the old one at some point. Those automatons that particularly believed in the cause of the Artificer Conclave might instead take the name of one of the conclave's members in honor of the cause that they gave their body to support. Some automatons prefer to change their names over their lifetimes, either selecting a new name from a culture they encountered or adding a title to represent a significant moment in their lives. In some cases an automaton will use a particularly cherished title in place of any other name.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alnhaman, Busmin, The Doleful, Enoh, Himar, Kantral, The Kindred, Numinar, Scholar, Tehkis, Wayfarer, Yulmian</p>\n<h2>Automaton Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Utopian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.</p>\n<h2>Automaton Heritages</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.2kMltxs2rmxRSxfV]{Hunter Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.J0eAmntxXywr9sGt]{Mage Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.j1nzBc9Pui7vsJ9o]{Sharpshooter Automaton}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.y24ykEUfpIu5Gp6D]{Warrior Automaton}</p>"

          "name": "Awakened Animal",
          "text": "<p>You once enjoyed the simple and boundless pleasures of nature with an innocent, uncluttered mind. You lived from moment to moment, never questioning what comes next or pondering the ramifications of what happened before. You were at one with the wild. Then came the event that changed everything. You drank from a glowing lake, someone pulled a magical prank, a druid sought to elevate your mind. You were pulled out of the present moment of the wild and into a land of thought. For the first time, you realized you had a past.</p>\n<p>For the first time, you started to think about your future. Now you experience the world in a whole new way. You become aware of dangers that never occurred to you before, but there are pleasures and wonders aplenty in this new world, too. That's a good thing, because there's no going back to how things were.</p>\n<p>Awakened animals were normal animals that underwent an experience that awakened their minds, giving them full intelligence and the ability to perceive the world through a lens of thought. There are many mysterious ways for animals to awaken, but the most well-known path is through the ritual <em>awaken animal</em>.</p>\n<p>Every animal takes the process of awakening differently. For some, the opening of their mind is electric, allowing them to perceive and ponder the world like never before. Others are overwhelmed by emotions and thoughts that they didn't ask for and weren't ready to hold. Most people who would awaken an animal assume that the animal they awaken will be full of wonder and gratitude and aren't prepared for the wide variety of responses they receive: shock, sadness, euphoria, curiosity, and anger are common (but not the only ones).</p>\n<p>No matter how an awakened animal reacts, they still must find their way in the world. Some awakened animals try to go back to their lives but almost always find themselves disconnected from their unawakened peers. Others embrace the civilized world entirely, doing their best to navigate a world built for humanoids. Over time, awakened animals find themselves moving between both the civilized world and the wild, for each holds only a part of what they need from life.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is extremely outside the norm and crosses between the civilized and natural worlds, you should play an awakened animal.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<p>Negotiate between humanoid societies and creatures of the wilderness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oscillate between rumination and acting with wild aggression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think you are a beast who is easily provoked.</li>\n<li>Want to study you as an oddity without respect for your agency or comfort.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Awakened animals are very similar in appearance to the animals they once were. From a glance, it is difficult for humanoids to tell an awakened animal apart from others of its species. On closer inspection, most humanoids notice something different about the eyes and movements of an awakened animal. The awakened animal carries themself in a way that is self-aware, and even those who don't know that the animal is awakened feel that difference. Often awakened animals take on the practice of wearing clothing and other adornments, and using tools, which truly make their awakened nature obvious.</p>\n<p>Animals recognize awakened animals instantly and react with trepidation at first. If welcomed, eventually the animal will settle and approach the awakened animal. It takes a long time for an animal to be truly comfortable around its awakened brethren, but over time it can happen.</p>\n<p>Traumatic awakenings sometimes create stunning visual differences in an awakened animal. There are tales of awakened bears with flame-red fur and birds with ghostly feathers.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Awakened animals are rare enough and separate enough that few find themselves traveling together, let alone making their own societies. Awakened animals often settle into the societies that are close by, integrating in disguise as a \"typical\" animal or overtly as craftspeople and laborers. While an awakened animal may decide that humanoid society is not for them, those that stay do not find much trouble in adapting. Most places in Golarion have seen enough that people get over their initial shock at seeing a talking house cat or songbird quickly.</p>\n<p>Awakened animals who have turned their back on \"civilized\" life tend to create animal societies that they are the natural rulers and leaders of. They use their intelligence to create order and structure that animals of their type wouldn't otherwise be able to do. There are tales in Ustalav of large wolf packs made of several combined packs led by an awakened wolf. The pack roams the countryside, protecting villages from incursions of undead. In Isger, merchants tell tales of bears who attack caravans, but do only enough damage to steal the goods before leaving.</p>\n<p>There are also rumors of a city full of awakened animals in Iobaria named Roam. Most awakened animals hear about it at some point in their lives. Some think of it as a fanciful dream, but many do attempt to find it. Roam is said to be the true home of all awakened animals, a place where their intellect and wild spirits are equally welcome.</p>\n<p>Animals use their senses to identify others instead of names, so their relationship with naming tends to reflect that. They might give friends nicknames that correspond to vivid feelings and sensory information. They often do this for themselves as well, only straying from these conventions if they are using a name they were given as a pet or companion or if they are trying to follow the conventions of the society around them. Sometimes they blend their instinctual approach with a more conventional name to create something bombastic and proud.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Redfur, Snarling Eye, King Halfhorn, Blacknose, Jewelmouth, Queen Scale, Yellowbeak, Bigclaw, Grinning Maw, Scowl</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Awakened animals tend to see the world through a lens of natural order. Those who are unsettled by humans or have been traumatized by them typically live within nature, while those driven by curiosity or structure seek to find a place in the more ordered and rule-bound nature of humanoid society.</p>\n<p>There is no uniform religion among awakened animals, but it is unsurprising that gods with domains in the natural world, like Gozreh, are popular. There are small groups of awakened animals who worship destructive gods such as Lamashtu and Rovagug. Those who were awakened by a companion might adopt that companion's outlook, and possibly adopt that companion's religion as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> explore your newfound sentience, enjoy the creature comforts of humanoid civilization; often other edicts related to your animal side, such as \"keep the pack together\" for a canine or \"always wash your food\" for a raccoon</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> revert to purely animalistic behaviors</p>\n<h2>Awakened Animal Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> Your ancestry Hit Points depend on the size you choose (see below): 6 HP if you're Tiny or Small, 8 HP if you're Medium, or 10 HP if you're Large.</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Choose the size appropriate to your animal: Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> Determined by your heritage</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

You can wear, hold, wield, and use items. Which limbs you use to manipulate items and how many are determined by you and your GM, but for the rules you function like a humanoid with two hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Awakened Mind</strong> Awakening altered your mind. You are no longer an animal, but you can still ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals of your kind. By remembering your instincts, you can allow yourself to be affected by spells and other effects as though you were an animal.</p>\n<h2>Awakened Animal Heritages</h2>\n<p>Animals come in a wide variety of body shapes with their own capabilities. Choose one of the following awakened animal heritages at 1st level. If you are an awakened animal with a versatile heritage, you still select one awakened animal heritage to inform your character's story and cosmetic form, but you do not gain any of its mechanical effects, though you have a land Speed of 20 feet unless you choose to be aquatic, in which case you have a swim Speed of 20 feet.

        "Azarketi": {
          "name": "Azarketi",
          "text": "<p>Azarketis, inheritors of a shattered empire's legacy, hold their proud traditions close but still surface to interact with the rest of the world.</p>\n<p>The aquatic humanoids of the Inner Sea share a somber and burdened history. Most refer to these aquatic peoples as gillmen or sometimes Low Azlanti, though they typically refer to themselves as azarketi, an Azlanti word that translates roughly to \"people of the seas.\" After Earthfall, these proud humans were mutated into aquatic servants by their alghollthu foes. Feeling like they don't fully belong with their human brethren nor with the sea that binds them, many azarketis struggle for a sense of identity and purpose. Though they remain distrusted by the surface dwellers, azarketis celebrate their unique lineage and their descent from the venerated Azlanti culture.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ambitiously seek to defy negative perceptions and prejudice laid against you.</li>\n<li>Be reclusive and skeptical of strangers.</li>\n<li>Regard the water as your home, but be intrigued by societies along the shore.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you are an ambassador to the sea and ask for your advice on nautical matters.</li>\n<li>Misunderstand your gentle gestures and mild expressions.</li>\n<li>Treat you with distrust or suspicion and anticipate betrayal from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Azarketis appear as regal, athletic humans. Their soft, hydrophilic skin ranges in tones from pearlescent white to pinkish, greenish, or brown tones reminiscent of coral. Azarketis with hair are somewhat rare; many sport fins or scaled ridges on their heads instead. Like the Azlanti people from which they descend, they often have violet eyes. Their aquatic lineage is obvious thanks to the sets of three gills on either side of their necks, as well as their webbed hands and feet. Azarketis have been known to live longer than humans, although they mature at about the same rate.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Azarketis lack the center for combined culture that helps other groups maintain a cohesive identity. The vastness of the oceans and waterways spread these swift-swimming people across the Inner Sea and beyond. Many azarketis rely only on the small familial groups in their immediate community and prefer smaller populations with comrades they trust and know intimately.</p>\n<p>Some azarketis prefer to foster connections with their surface-dwelling brethren. Living in ports, river towns and along the shore allows azarketis a greater scope of opportunities not afforded to exclusively land or sea peoples. Although integrating with land society can be difficult, azarketis manage by forming bonded communities. Members will often have fond familial names for one another, regardless of actual relation.</p>\n<p>If they have the means, some azarketis dress in attire reflecting their Azlanti heritage. More commonly, azarketis do their best to remain inconspicuous when they emerge from the water. Many will wear shemaghs or other head wrappings, which both hide their gills and provide a few extra comfortable hours out of water if soaked before donning.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>As they are typically outsiders to the domains of surface life, azarketis tend toward deities with an affinity for the ocean or other forms of water, the most popular being Gozreh. They are also likely to give reverence to other deities of nature or navigation, such as Desna.</p>\n<p>Some azarketis are tempted toward the call of the deep and serve their old alghollthu masters as gods. These individuals are enticed by eldritch entities such as the mysterious veiled masters—powerful beings of the deep ocean responsible for both uplifting and destroying the Azlanti people.</p>\n<p>Azarketis vary wildly in beliefs and values, as evidenced by their broad divergence in allegiance; thus, azarketis can be of any alignment.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Azarketis often take the names of nautical, weather, or geographical features important to the azarketi's family. Other azarketi groups will choose human names in order to encourage conformity with surface cultures. Some azarketi names have been passed down through so many generations that they still use ancient Azlanti roots or refer to bodies of water that no longer exist.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aft, Aliz, Cascade, Delta, Harbor, Ilani, Inkua, Jib, Lagoon, Lobay, Marine, Tidal, Windward, Zarket</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Azarketi Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet, Swim 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Alghollthu</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

After the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a -1 status penalty to Fortitude saves.

        "Centaur": {
          "name": "Centaur",
          "text": "<p>Centaurs are proud nomads who range far and wide across their ancestral territories, protecting their lands from exploitation and intrusion. They are survivalists who forge tight bonds with family and community and stand firm in the face of danger. Many are skilled hunters, trackers, and warriors who do battle with bow, steel, and hooves. Brave and stubborn, they're willing to challenge even the fiercest foes and largest forces to protect their homes, kin, and the land within their domain.</p>\n<p>As hunter-gatherers, centaurs rely upon the bounty of the natural world for sustenance. As youths, they're taught to nurture and respect their surrounding ecosystems so the land remains healthy and bountiful throughout their lives and is preserved for future generations. Centaurs understand that a land exploited or despoiled is a land unfit for survival, just as a herd overhunted dies off. In the ancient past, such carelessness and greed resulted in malnutrition, famine, and loss of territory, and most centaurs are careful not to repeat the mistakes of their distant forbears. Thus, centaurs prefer to adapt to their surroundings, rather than abuse their environments for their own comfort. They're guardians of nature, and their beliefs lead them to clash with careless urbanites and expansionists over exploitative and dangerous practices, including overhunting, overlogging, pollution, and city development.</p>\n<p>Centaurs are happiest when mobile, and many feel restless or fall ill if cooped up or sedentary for too long. They're fond of racing and athletics, and are aggressively competitive, always striving to best their previous achievements and to outdo their fellows. This often results in centaurs being judged as contentious and boorish by outsiders. Most centaurs enjoy physical contests, particularly team sports, and award small but valued tokens to victors—though for many centaurs, bragging rights are the greatest prize of all. Not all centaurs compete as athletes, but most centaurs enjoy exertion and take naturally to activities that get their blood pumping and their heart racing.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who runs free and proud, always looking out for their companions, you should play a centaur.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to great lengths to protect your home and the people you love.</li>\n<li>Enjoy competition, particularly organized sports and tests of strength or endurance.</li>\n<li>Respect and value the natural world.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you're an expert archer or fierce warrior.</li>\n<li>Think you understand horses.</li>\n<li>Consider you aggressive and overly competitive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Centaurs have the form of muscular humans with the bodies of horses from the waist down. They're hardy and stable, capable of carrying heavy burdens and cumbersome loads for long periods. Centaurs display great variation in their size, hair, and coloration, with most averaging 7 feet tall and weighing over 2,000 pounds. While coloration is often inherited, a centaur's coat markings are unpredictable, and many take pride in the distinct patterns, placements, and chromatic shifts of their coats. These markings are present at birth and don't change over the course of a centaur's life. In ages past, a centaur's markings were used to divine their future. Though this tradition has fallen out of favor since the death of prophecy, some particularly rare markings are still considered lucky or an ill omen today.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Centaurs are originally from the continent of Casmaron, and most still reside there today, particularly in Iblydos and Iobaria. In Iblydos, many centaurs are agrarian, carefully and sustainably tending farmland and gardens, particularly for wildflowers, olives, figs, and grapes, from which they vinify a beloved (and potent) local wine. Thanks to popular folktales regarding the near-mythical centaurs Elthavus and Ventriadi, famed mentors to numerous ancient Iblydan hero-gods of old, it is traditionally believed that centaurs excel at training heroes. Centaurs have done nothing to dissuade this notion. Most centaurs enjoy the act of mentorship, and aging military leaders, healers, astronomers, engineers, and other experts are often thrilled to pass their knowledge down to younger generations. Thanks to their competitive nature, some centaur teachers compete with one another over who can train the most promising students, soldiers, and intellectuals.</p>\n<p>Over the ages, centaurs spread throughout much of the Inner Sea via Iobaria, most notably the Isle of Kortos, where grudges against the citizens of Absalom are long-enduring. There, centaurs wage guerrilla warfare against the constant intruders into their territory and clash with nearby harpies and minotaurs. They range across the lowlands and forests, in alpine meadows, and throughout the Immenwood.</p>\n<p>Centaurs maintain large territories that they range through in a nomadic lifestyle, living as mobile communities of hunter-gatherers. These areas are well defined and have been maintained through generations. At the heart of each territory is a centralized location of import. Often a religious site, meeting place, or camp is maintained for sick and the elderly centaurs who can no longer travel with the rest of their band. Occasionally, this camp is a permanent settlement, constructed of wood, limestone, clay bricks, or marble, depending on the region and environment, and surrounded by fields of carefully tended crops or flocks of chickens, goats, or sheep. Centaurs have a passing fondness for animals, but rarely keep domesticated pets and find horses off-putting.</p>\n<p>A centaur band is a tight-knit community, led by a respected member of the group who's proven capable, wise, and calm under pressure. Usually, these leaders are middle-aged and older, as centaurs consider life experience a necessary quality in a leader. Rarely, a centaur or band chooses to become sedentary or integrate with a larger nation. These are often small bands whose territories have been destroyed or stolen, emissaries representing their bands, adventurers, loners, outcasts, or even bands who simply can't survive against a superior military enemy. Regardless, this choice is not made lightly, as most centaurs feel constrained in urban environments, particularly in settlements built for people smaller than them.</p>\n<p>When built, centaur constructions are large and airy to allow for range of movement. Their buildings are communal, always aboveground, and open to the elements in places—wide doors held open, or roof and wall hatches to allow in light. Most are built of wood, thatch, and mudbrick while in Iblydos, harder materials like marble and stone are more likely. In Iobaria, they often repurpose old cyclopean ruins, which offer plentiful space.</p>\n<p>In Iobaria, herbalism, medicine, and magical purification are more commonly valued skills, thanks to the incessant plagues and illnesses that are prevalent in the region. A centaur band dare not travel without a few skilled healers, and even hunting parties and scouts rarely split off for long. Centaur healers and herbalists frequently put aside their differences and affiliations to exchange knowledge at annual meetings known as Soothings. There, band representatives from across the nation exchange medical breakthroughs and other knowledge. The largest of these Soothings occurs biannually in Vurnirn, the largest centaur settlement in Iobaria.</p>\n<p>In Kaer Maga, Cheliax, Molthune, and Oprak, centaurs have assimilated with the larger nations, sometimes living as citizens and merchants, but more often serving as soldiers and mercenaries. In Garund, centaurs range across plains and savannas. They get along well with other nature-conscious cultures, teaming up with catfolk, tripkees, elves, and orcs to battle demons near Lake Ocota, undead near the borders of Geb and Mzali, and other dangerous threats. Centaurs remain open foes with Taldor and Andoran, remembering well the old wars with the expansionist Taldan empire that drove them into the Verduran Forest. Many in these regions dream of retaking their ancestral territories back from Taldan and Andoran control—a dangerous pipe dream certain to result in the deaths of countless centaurs.</p>\n<p>Centaurs believe in reform and often rely on community pressure to discourage harmful behaviors. The unrepentant and the greatest transgressors face exile beyond the band's borders; centaurs avoid ending the lives of their own, except during times of war and mid-battle. While some centaur bands, serving demons and other foul gods, may attack other centaurs, even they prefer to harry other foes.</p>\n<p>Centaurs consider saddles and bridles both restricting and shamefully insulting, akin to being shackled and caged. They despise being ridden and refuse to serve as a mount except in the direst of circumstances or emergencies, or only by their most trusted companions.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have a single name and sometimes earn an appellation through their deeds, appearance, or personality traits, such as Thunderhoof or Windrunner. When beyond their territorial borders, centaurs use their band's name as an additional identifier. Centaurs who settle in other nations either adopt their band name as a last name or create a unique last name of their own, founding a lineage that's passed down to future generations.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aecora, Demeleon, Ertris, Hycanthe, Irdan, Jalvayne, Karala, Malion, Oridius, Tolron, Vorag</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>The beliefs of a centaur often depend on where and how they were raised. Many centaurs follow the Green Faith or worship deities who share their respect for nature, such as Cernunnos, Erastil, or Gozreh. Others feel kinship with Desna, goddess of travel. Healers and herbalists favor Immonhiel or Pharasma. In urban areas, Kurgess and Gorum are favorites, depending on the centaur's temperament and profession.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have two primary religious figures: Greenspeakers and Faithspeakers. Greenspeakers are one with nature, followers of the Green Faith, exceptional herbalists, and otherwise learned in the ways of the natural world. Faithspeakers are pious devotees of gods, demons, celestials, and other beings. Both are given equal respect, considered two sides of the same coin. Through their Speakers, centaurs interact with the world beyond what they can see and feel, and lead ceremonies, celebrations, and prayers. Celebrations are usually divided into two categories: beginnings and endings, with beginnings such as weddings, births, and spring celebrated at dawn, and endings such as harvests, funerals, and partings celebrated at dusk. Death rites vary by region and culture, but sedentary bands and those who cultivate fields, gardens, or crops, often burn their dead on pyres, releasing their spirits from their material bodies, then using the resulting ashes to fertilize fields or gardens so the dead can continue to serve their community. In regions with rocky ground or frigid climate, centaurs instead bury their dead under cairns and stone mounds.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>ensure knowledge is passed on, live in harmony with the natural world, play fair in an honest competition</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>fail to roam, aid in the wanton destruction of a natural landscape</p>\n<h2>Centaur Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Fey, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Conrasus are shards of cosmic force given consciousness who construct intricate exoskeletons to interface with the mortal world. Both an integral part of the underlying processes of the universe and strangely set apart, conrasus look to aeons to understand their existence.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Conrasus aren't entirely clear on their own origins. Some historians think them a failed experiment of a wizardly cabal—possibly a splinter of artificers from the ancient Jitska Imperium—who desperately hoped to bind a pleroma to bolster their army but who accidentally conjured shattered scraps of the aeon instead. Others believe conrasus were built by their ancestors using an accelerated, iterative evolution process as natural as one designed by those who build portions of their own bodies could ever hope to achieve. Most likely, it is a mix of the two.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do your best to determine and act upon the will of your guiding aeon.</li>\n<li>Use rituals and repetitive actions as a means to meditate and reflect on your purpose.</li>\n<li>Have difficulty applying your cosmic instincts and senses to a physical existence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>View you as part of a hivemind at best or lacking in free will at worst.</li>\n<li>Have trouble understanding your perspective or attempts at communication.</li>\n<li>Look to you as the expert on any matters involving aeons or related beings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The true form of a conrasu is an abstract chunk of spiritual essence. While their being exists beyond the truth of humanoid senses, to the mortal eye, their body usually resembles a globe of light, darkness, or space. Floating, internal pinpricks of illumination sit inside the ball, slightly obscured as if peeking through a gelatinous substance. These \"cores\" surround themselves with bodies made out of still-living wood, creating the form that most people recognize as a conrasu.</p>\n<p>Conrasus themselves are called to a path and, once they find it, shape frames to create a suitable form, leading to a wide variety of appearances. As a conrasu ages, the supple green wood of ttheir body hardens, causing their limbs to lose mobility. Conrasus must constantly grow new arms and roots for their living exoskeleton, leaving their frozen limbs as immobile effigies along their shell.</p>\n<p>Conrasus can't maintain their integrity without their wooden exoskeletons. A conrasu that loses its exoskeleton dissipates and dies, though they can be returned to life with magic like other beings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>There are three distinct types of conrasus. Maintainers tend and care for others, believing they must cultivate a proper balance between various forces. Shapers build and direct those around them, and feel that balance is maintained by those who strive to preserve the world's equilibrium. Lastly, correctors fix problems of all sorts, often acting as stalwart bastions of law who perceive the world in absolutes, with few to no shades of gray. True balance can be achieved only in cases where pressure and force have been applied to make necessary changes.</p>\n<p>On rare occasions, a conrasu may hear and heed the call of another form of extraplanar being. One might serve a psychopomp, another an archon, and yet another might become a witch and adopt an unknown figure as a patron.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Many conrasus consider themselves bound to a specific aeon, following them like a deity and doing what they believe to be the aeon's bidding. As a result, almost all conrasus are lawful neutral in alignment.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Conrasus have little in the way of consciousness as others understand it before they self-actualize and leave the nursery-towns where they sprouted. That includes a name, a concept of gender, and even the passage of time beyond their little bubbles-these are picked up in the wider world.

They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair and beards, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of maturity and honor among many dwarf clans.</p>\n<p>Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming-of-age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age.

          "text": "<p>As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving Golarion in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes. Elves value kindness, intellect, and beauty, with many elves striving to improve their manners, appearance, and culture. Their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, as elves who spend their lives among shorterlived peoples often become morose after watching generations of companions age and die. These elves are known as Forlorn among their fellow elves.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans.</li>\n<li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li>\n<li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and rounded, featuring large and often vibrantly colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p>\n<p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The inborn patience and intellectual curiosity of elves make them excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge.</p>\n<p>Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which elves call ‘ilduliel,' but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time. An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry.

These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and have strange occult powers. Some fetchlings develop their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper about figures that emerge from shaded corners and then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other means, they've spread across Golarion and the planes beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.</p>\n<p>The first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago, when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and cast the world into darkness, one small group of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious hooded figure known as the Widow answered their call, slicing open a passage into the Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through, trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep shadow. As they navigated the plane's strange environs and dangerous inhabitants, its nature slowly worked monumental changes on the survivors.</p>\n<p>If you want a character more at home in a mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral gloom, and who embodies the dualities of light and darkness, you should play a fetchling.</p>\n<h2>You Might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live and work in gloomy areas of dim light with plenty of shadows, only providing bright light when expecting visitors.</li>\n<li>Look to people's shadows as a way of identifying them, alongside features like stature or facial structure.</li>\n<li>Maintain composure when faced with strange creatures and circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you have shadowy powers, such as the ability to consume light as food, melt into darkness, or travel between planes.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be cautious, reserved, and a loner.</li>\n<li>Express interest in your ancestral physiological connection to the Shadow Plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Most of the Shadow Plane appears as an altered version of the Material Plane but leeched of color. These same forces in the Shadow Plane have touched fetchlings, whose skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray between. Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Fetchlings' reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling's most notable feature is their shadow, which almost never faithfully reflects their body. Instead, fetchling shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most fetchlings remain close to Golarion on either the Material or Shadow Planes, either forming majority-fetchling communities or forging solitary paths. Both planar groups tend to be insular; many fetchling cultures preserve memories of their early, perilous days confronting the Shadow Plane's hostile or beguiling denizens. Their predilection for forming tight communal bonds and adapting to local customs has spread to become part of broader fetchling culture, reinforced by two major fetchling groups—the Estlaris and Sharedars—who live in the shadow of more powerful entities.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A culture of survival passed down through generations means many fetchlings prefer to maintain a cautious worldview and adapt to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some choose to join with local powers for personal or communal advancement, or to tear systems down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter what they see as fetters that bind them and their communities.</p>\n<p>No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods' powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Fetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same.

Their unorthodox appearance can make it difficult for them to find a place for themselves in the world.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Magic and science that can warp bone and twist sinew are all too common on Golarion. Fleshwarps are those who have been permanently altered by such methods—sometimes a sapient being created whole cloth from inanimate flesh, but often a victim unwillingly transformed by strange energies or sadistic creators.</p>\n<p>The ancestry name \"fleshwarp\" is an umbrella term, since on Golarion the actual fleshwarping process is more infamously well-known than are alterations caused by uncontrolled magic, technology, or fringe science. Whether practiced by Thassilonian wizards, Nexian fleshcrafters, or the drow of the Darklands, fleshwarping is the craft of reshaping flesh and mind in vats of foul magical reagents. This has led some scholars of monsters to argue that only those beings created by traditional fleshwarping should be considered fleshwarps. Regardless of the source of their altered forms, fleshwarps bear their new shape forever, transformed beings living a wild and strange existence beyond what was possible for their original ancestry.</p>\n<p>Although fleshwarps are humanoid, no two look the same. One might possess limbs in unusual places and skin as smooth as glass, while another might have a thick matting of spiny fur. Some might have animalistic features, like a boar snout, scales, or cloven hooves. Others have entirely alien appearances, such as bulging eyes on the backs of their hands. Some may have only subtly uncanny features that differentiate them, such as glowing teeth, smoking eyes, or fingernails made of bone. The only commonality among fleshwarps is their mismatched nature. Let your imagination run wild when creating a fleshwarp character!</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is tough and hardy, can change their form as they grow, and can use their wholly unique appearance to inspire awe or fear in others, you should play a fleshwarp.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace your unusual appearance to inspire respect or fear.</li>\n<li>Be used to relying on yourself.</li>\n<li>Distrust large groups of people, particularly mobs, based on past experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find your physiology fascinating or terrifying.</li>\n<li>Assume you are an expert on strange creatures or occult phenomena.</li>\n<li>Consider you an enigmatic and unpredictable—and perhaps even dangerous—outsider.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps are humanoids, ranging from 5 to 7 feet tall and from just under 100 pounds to more than 300 pounds. The proportion and appearance of their limbs and features differ widely, but fleshwarps functionally have two legs, two arms, and a single head; a fleshwarp with more limbs than this should consider an appropriate ancestry feat to reflect this variance, or one of their limbs might be vestigial and mostly nonfunctional. Fleshwarps differ widely in their appearance due to the unique circumstances of their creation. Even fleshwarp siblings or two people transformed through the same procedure might look wildly different.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps are so few in number that congregations of them are rare. They most often live on their own, with a small family group, or at the outskirts of a community. Some thrive in cities, however, where they can remain anonymous among the crowds while pursuing careers that allow them to avoid contact with people who might fear or persecute them.</p>\n<p>Fleshwarps value endurance and are quick to learn from others, so those who come into contact with others of their kind usually share stories that help each other survive, hide, or thrive more effectively. How a fleshwarp formed can be a painful or horrifying subject, one they consider rude to discuss with anyone besides close friends or loved ones.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps have little to gain from the broader society, and therefore rarely work to support society in turn, beyond perhaps helping other fleshwarps. They need to be able to adapt quickly to survive on their own. As a consequence, few fleshwarps are lawful. Although bigoted or short-sighted people view fleshwarps as monsters, fleshwarps are no more or less prone to evil than any other people, and most seek only to live their lives without trouble. Most are neutral in alignment, for while alienation doesn't force a fleshwarp to feel contempt for others, neither does it encourage a fleshwarp to avoid it. This is especially true for fleshwarps living in the societies that gave birth to their traumatic transformation. Fleshwarps aren't often casually religious; most either have little to do with faith at all (viewing themselves as scorned by the gods or simply seeing faith as impractical for survival) or are exceptionally devout. Religious fleshwarps often revere Arazni, Calistria, Desna, or Gozreh; evil fleshwarps typically turn to Lamashtu, finding consolation in the Mother of Monsters.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Fleshwarps can come from-and thus have names from-any culture or ancestry, but some give themselves new names after being transformed, whether to celebrate the change, recognize a new phase of their lives, or conceal their past identity. Many fleshwarps also carry a descriptive nickname granted to them by others, such as \"Triple Handed,\" \"Barkfoot,\" or \"Many-Mouth.\"</p>\n<p>Fleshwarps don't keep nicknames they find personally offensive, but they tend to keep ones that describe their distinctive appearances or that are given by people they care about.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Borble, Dag, Feff, Hurn, Kemp, Omber, Ostro, Shurni, Surm, Wumpin</p>\n<h2>Fleshwarp Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium or Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Ghoran": {
          "name": "Ghoran",
          "text": "<p>These intelligent plant people, created by a long-dead druid, possess a sort of immortality through their seeds—unless these are destroyed by external events other than merely the ravages of time.</p>\n<p>During the height of the wars between Geb and Nex long ago, the archmage Nex asked the renegade druid Ghorus to create a plant that would feed his people even in the most inhospitable land. Ghorus did so, developing a flower that would adapt to every environment and withstand every sort of magecraft and spellworking. He succeeded too well. In the strange soil of the Impossible Lands, the flower grew and soon began to think—and then to walk and speak. These were the first ghorans. Despite their new awareness, ghorans found that many other peoples were adept at ignoring inconvenient truths, especially those involving where their next meal might come from. Bit by bit, seed by seed, ghorans grew themselves into humanoid forms, hoping to engender sympathy by mirroring the appearance of humanoids. It eventually worked, and the ghorans won citizenship and protected status in the nation of Nex. Even so, time and predation has taken its toll; the population of ghorans is small and ever dwindling.</p>\n<p>Each ghoran is essentially an ancient spark of life that inhabits, successively, a series of plantlike bodies. Every twenty years or so, a ghoran produces a seed. Their old body withers away as their soul enters the seed, which then swiftly produces a new body. The process brings with it minor changes in personality and some loss of more distant memories, such that each new ghoran is related to their predecessor while still being a different individual. The art of creating more ghorans died with the druid Ghorus, so they're a tiny but stable minority in the Impossible Lands, dwindling bit by bit over the centuries as a few of them fall to violence and mischance.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who's an ancient and alien soul, trying to survive and thrive in a strange and hostile world, you should play a ghoran.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Offhandedly mention events from thousands of years ago.</li>\n<li>Find \"animal\" behaviors strange.</li>\n<li>Constantly make small changes to your body.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a hard time recognizing you after not seeing you for a while.</li>\n<li>Are either intimidated or fascinated by how long you've lived and how much you know.</li>\n<li>Have heard you're delicious.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Roughly humanoid in size and shape, a ghoran's body is mostly made up of a fibrous plant material resembling a woody vine, with a face like an enormous, colorful flower. Ghorans have a great deal of control over the shape and structure of their bodies: with a few hours of effort, a ghoran might make themselves taller or shorter, long-limbed or barrel-chested. They have a reputation for tasting deliciously sweet and herbaceous. Most people merely find this quality a curiosity and don't attempt to take a bite, but animals in the wild will sometimes seek them out and attack them. Though they can learn to smile or laugh to fit in with other ancestries, they tend to use a different set of emotional signifiers, fluttering their face-petals to show happiness and making a rustling sound when agitated or upset. Every ghoran has a large cavity within their torso that contains a large seed. When a ghoran's body becomes too decrepit to function, they impart their memories into the seed and plant it into the ground. Within 1 to 2 months, a new ghoran body finishes growing from the seed, and the original ghoran collapses into a pile of inert organic matter. This curious method of propagation leaves a ghoran vulnerable, and many ghorans are defensive about the process among non-ghoran peoples.Being plants, ghorans have no innate understanding of gender in the human sense. Ghorans who find themselves in the company of other ancestries sometimes adopt a more masculine or feminine form, though just as many don't bother.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Ghorans originated in Nex, and most reside as a tiny minority population in that land. In its major cities, they have built little enclaves of their own in neighborhoods featuring sweeping parks and massive trees, with the largest of these enclaves being in Quantium. While they don't possess the magical ability to enter an extradimensional home within a tree like dryads, ghorans live among the trees, typically making their homes within the neighborhoods' big parks. They are extremely skilled at building their abodes so that they don't disrupt the lives of the local flora. Visitors to a ghoran enclave might not realize initially that they've entered a home, assuming instead that they're in a recreational public space. Ghorans don't typically mind the unexpected company so long as the visitors are respectful of the park, of their homes, and of any ghorans they meet. The ghorans who live in major cities are relatively social and accepting of other ancestries, and they tend to be eager to interact, learn about others, and engage in trade. Outside of these cities, ghorans inhabit small, remote communities in the foothills of the Shattered Range and dwell in secluded forests, and they tend to be much more isolationist. Remembering well that Ghorus originally created their ancestry as food for the \"animals,\" they generally have no great desire to get to know other ancestries. However, as each new incarnation slightly shifts a ghoran's personality, they sometimes develop a wanderlust that spurs them to leave an isolated home and travel into the wider world. Often, such ghorans hold bits—or even troves—of ancient lore lost to the outside world for many years, so their journeys can sometimes lead to important new discoveries for others in the Impossible Lands and beyond.</p>\n<p>Among themselves, ghorans cooperate easily and instinctively, with no need for a formal government. Work is apportioned by a silent consensus derived from thousands of years of experience, as everyone does what they're best at to cover necessary tasks. This silent consensus is already practiced at determining how to adjust and adapt when one ghoran falls ill or changes in a new incarnation. The addition of new ghorans traveling from afar or of members of other ancestries can sometimes throw off this natural rhythm. The new addition is an unknown quantity, so the entire community keeps tabs on the newcomers, to a potentially unsettling extent, for a short period of analysis. This practice isn't out of any distrust or desire for harm, but rather out of curiosity and a need to understand what the newcomers do well and where they need assistance. Once the ghoran community has drawn a conclusion, they adjust their actions accordingly—everyone simply begins to perform tasks differently to allow newcomers to fit in and contribute, with no official meeting or declaration. In most cases, one of the members of the community realizes they should tell non-ghoran newcomers what the community expects of them, but sometimes no one realizes there's a need to communicate. When this happens, it can leave the ghoran community and the newcomers perplexed at the others' actions and choices, as the community expects the newcomers to simply pitch in and fill the need while the newcomers wait to be told what the community expects of them.</p>\n<p>Ghoran communities, operating on this ancient consensus, generally don't have anything resembling leaders. Nonetheless, a community will sometimes appoint a single ghoran as an envoy to outsiders and even give them a title to make the \"animals\" more comfortable when receiving a message from the whole community.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Ghorans typically lack driving forces toward good or evil, though their plant-derived values can sometimes make them come across as amoral to people who are not likewise plant based. They have a slight tendency toward law, especially in their own communities. While most ghorans aren't particularly religious, spiritually oriented ones tend to worship nature by means of the Green Faith or, less commonly, Gozreh or one of the Eldest (such as the plantlike Green Mother). They rarely find interest in human-centric deities, as ghorans have distinctly different thought processes and priorities. Faith is a matter that usually doesn't change much from seed to seed and incarnation to incarnation, and that means that the newer deities, especially those ascended in the last few millennia (\"recently,\" from the ghoran perspective) have almost no foothold in ghoran communities.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Most ghorans pick a new name with each incarnation, usually selecting a name or concept that they found pleasing in a past life. Occasionally, a ghoran might reuse a name for several incarnations in a row, especially if remaining in a community of other peoples, though each incarnation is still a distinct person.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Amsalu, Ash, Emnet, Sieri, Ooniel, Arshmarish, Velt, Delphinium, Hach, Emerald, Sable</p>\n<h2>Ghoran Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "Gnome": {
          "name": "Gnome",
          "text": "<p>Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it's unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction, known as the Bleaching, strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning.</li>\n<li>Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can't keep up.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations.</li>\n<li>Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven't begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue.</p>\n<p>Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. A gnome can theoretically live to any age if they can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely, but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than around 400 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>While most gnomes adopt some of the cultural practices of the region in which they live, they tend to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. Exceptionally few gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and most gnomes wouldn't know what to do with such a state if they had one.</p>\n<p>By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. Gnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce, and they often go by shorter nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it's considered to be.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Abroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai, Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Though gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place.

Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p>\n<p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as \"longshanks,\" won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say.

Their fingers and feet are coated with a thin layer of chitin. A goloma's face is an oblong wedge made of smooth chitin, almost resembling a wooden mask. Protruding from this face are eight gelatinous, shining eyes. A goloma's mouth and jaw are located beneath their face-plate, and a bony crest juts from the top of their chitinous visage. The back of a goloma's head and neck is coated in black hair that is filled with thousands of tiny, peering eyes. These eyes tend to glow and squirm as they look around-an unsettling sight for most.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>An ancient goloma story states that during a calamity unleashed long ago, gods and demons burst forth from the earth to steal the eyes from other creatures. Only the golomas and others who were in hiding were spared-yet golomas soon began to be hunted by the now two-eyed people, who were hungry to take goloma eyes to replace what they had lost. This accurately sums up most golomas' mentalities: to be exposed is to be vulnerable, and to trust a stranger is deadly. Golomas usually travel and live with groups of other golomas, as this is where they feel most comfortable.</p>\n<p>Golomas learn at a young age to be vigilant at all times, observing the environment for any irregularities and then reacting with quick, calculated instinct rather than deliberative action. Other ancestries often perceive golomas to be paranoid and hypervigilant. Golomas are also better at wide-scale observation than observation of specific things-they can easily notice commonalities across large fields but have difficulty remembering what a specific object or creature looked like. This only increases their paranoia, as they have trouble visually distinguishing known friends from potentially hostile foes.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Golomas tend to focus on their own survival and thus are typically neutral, though those who find more comfort in conformity than others trend toward lawful alignments. Golomas often pay homage to Kalekot, a deity of protective fear, as the guardian of their people, though not one to be trusted. Kalekot is called upon to curse those who victimize golomas, as most feel that justice can only be attained using supernatural means. Other popular gods include Mazludeh and Grandmother Spider, who encourage the strength of community, though a typical goloma's idea of community is often very insular.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>A goloma's true name is kept among golomas, as there are hundreds of cautionary tales of what could happen if another creature learns a goloma's true name. Names tend to lack soft syllables, which golomas often struggle to pronounce, and typically consist of hard consonants and individually enunciated vowels instead. Among other people, golomas tend to use names that are intended to be intimidating, taking elements and sounds from Aklo, Necril, or words from local languages that seem to cause strong reactions.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Biqkuul, Ehbouja, Haamaah, Kouzo, Quaerjii, Tebaazu, Uruueda, Zekuukeu</p>\n<h2>Goloma Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 30 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Goloma, Mwangi</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

While their curiosity sometimes drives them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.</li>\n<li>Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it's going to lead to trouble.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.</li>\n<li>Think you bring good luck with you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.</p>\n<p>Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wear shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.</p>\n<p>Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don't usually tend to congregate. They have few cultural centers in the Inner Sea region, and they instead tend to weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family. Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance for their people. However, they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren't afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture and beliefs of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean's role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>share good meals with friends and strangers alike, stand up to bullies and oppressors, stay beneath the taller folk's notice</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>take your luck for granted</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Halfling Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Halfling</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p>Taller and stronger than their goblin kin, hobgoblins are equals in strength and size to humans, with broad shoulders and long, powerful arms. The Avistani cycle of unthinking conflict with hobgoblins has recently been upended by Oprak, the newly established hobgoblin nation in the mountains between Nidal and Nirmathas. Now under strict orders to not start conflicts with other nations, these hobgoblins have begun to cautiously investigate in the spirit of cooperation rather than conquest. Many people, especially those who suffered terrible cruelties caused by hobgoblins, fear that this is simply a pause in aggression while Oprak gains enough strength to crush its rivals. Others hope these bold soldiers might prove to be powerful allies.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out the most effective and practical solutions to any problem.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourage a clear chain of command among any group you travel with, following orders even if you disagree with them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you dangerous, due to your reputation and intimidating appearance.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Recognize your incredible endurance, dedication, and discipline.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Hobgoblins have bald, wide heads and beady eyes, as well as gray skin that becomes steely blue when tanned. They're remarkably hardy; hobgoblins recover from illnesses quickly and are able to exert themselves for long periods of time with little difficulty.</p>\n<p>Hobgoblins mature quickly, and most can walk, talk, and hold a weapon by the time they are 1 year old. They reach adolescence by the age of 8 to 12 and adulthood around 14. Hobgoblins typically live up to 70 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Hobgoblins structure their society after military hierarchies. Even civilian groups such as farming collectives or trading houses organize into regiments, companies, and divisions. Hobgoblin veterans hold a high place in their society, usually becoming leaders or advisors. Magic is rarely practiced and often derided, as most hobgoblins don't trust it over the strength of their own sword arms. Their arts tend to have a military bent; many hobgoblins consider stirring marches and weaponsmithing the only artistic endeavors worth pursuing.</p>\n<p>Like goblins, hobgoblin names tend to be simple, though hobgoblin names usually sound more guttural and forceful. On rare occasions, hobgoblins will alter their names, keeping the core but adding aspects, usually in response to extreme trauma or a life-altering event. Hobgoblins have no surnames, considering them both pointless and presumptuous; an individual's merits and demerits are to be earned by their actions, not by an association with a particular lineage.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aze, Druknar, Ghargam, Hathkren, Imakra, Kralaeng, Mazkol, Olzu, Rezal, Sivkrag, Volmak, Zornum</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Most hobgoblins prefer to live within established hierarchies.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</p>\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes.

A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans have exceptionally mutable physical characteristics compared to other ancestries, with greater variance in height, weight, and other physical parameters.</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms.

        "Kashrishi": {
          "name": "Kashrishi",
          "text": "<p>Kashrishi make their homes in remote areas of the world. These quiet beings have stout, durable frames and distinctive crystalline horns. Their inherent psychic abilities make them natural empaths but also occasionally burden them with the unceasing thoughts of their neighbors.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi occupy a unique evolutionary branch native to the lands bordering the northern stretches of the Obari Ocean. Resembling halfling-sized bipedal rhinoceroses with the occasional odd insectile feature, kashrishi adapt to their environs with unusual efficiency, using a combination of rapid physical evolutions and inherent psychic powers. Kashrishi are often mistakenly referred to as having hive minds, though they're actually natural empaths, capable of discerning a creature's emotional state and impulses through proximity. This near-oracular behavior occasionally leads to misunderstandings with humanoids who think a kashrishi is reading their thoughts or otherwise magically influencing the conversation, though peoples more familiar with kashrishi come to value their unique insights and intuitive diplomacy.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi have an atypical level of control over their physical forms, thanks to their psychic powers, and can evolve new features over the course of a single generation. Typically, these features are intentionally cultivated to help deal with a particular environmental obstacle, such as a change in weather patterns, or if an invasive species affects available food supplies near their settlements.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi often tailor their evolutions to match the most successful creatures in their environment. Whether a testament to the resilience of insects or simply a quirk of their environment, many kashrishi evolutions are directly inspired by creatures like the rhinoceros beetle or giant water bug.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that's visually distinct, able to naturally access the occult powers of the mind, and great at quickly making friends wherever they go, you should play a kashrishi.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be easily taken aback by people who are particularly loud, expressive, or emotional.</li>\n<li>Prefer the peaceful quiet of remote islands, treetops, and caverns.</li>\n<li>Act as a parental figure for the more excitable among your companions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Underestimate your strength and resilience.</li>\n<li>Mistake you for being unsociable when you're actually taking time to process mental and physical cues of which they're completely unaware.</li>\n<li>Value you for your patience and insights.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kashrishi have short but wide frames with remarkable strength for their size. All have signature crystalline horns, though these can grow in a variety of configurations. The most common kashrishi, xyloshis, have a large primary horn and between one and three smaller horns, typically arranged linearly from the tip of their nose and spanning along their nose and brow.</p>\n<p>While most kashrishi have light sandy or gray skin tones, their coloration can also echo the tones of their crystalline horns; sapphire, ruby, or emerald patterns aren't so uncommon as to cause another kashrishi to take notice. Kashrishi with strong connections to specific creatures with whom they share their home environments might take on skin patterns or colorations that mirror those creatures. Some stories even talk about kashrishi with wings and butterfly patterns that cover their bodies, though no such kashrishi has been seen in the Impossible Lands for at least a century.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Despite their small stature, kashrishi tend to be terrible at hiding. Their crystalline horns are likely to flare with magical light when they exercise their innate magical powers, and they're raised in an environment where their parents or guardians can almost always find them by feeling for their emotions. As a result, kashrishi tend to be excessively honest and kind, avoiding harmful deceptions but also employing enough tact to ensure they don't evoke unpleasant emotional reactions from others.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi lack a clear concept of charity, not because they're cruel or inconsiderate, but rather because their worldview is inherently inclusive of the people around them. Rare indeed is the kashrishi who exercises casual cruelty or who leaves another member of the community in need. Such actions lead to emotional reactions that cause turmoil for all kashrishi in the vicinity.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi enjoy various team games, employing games of trivia as measures of both knowledge and psychic ability. They also appreciate games that involve bluffs and double-bluffs with blind cards, testing their abilities to keep their minds clear and their thoughts organized. Kashrishi don't generally condone the act of gambling with outsiders, as many find it challenging to deal with the implications of their psychic abilities, even if they strive to keep their powers secret.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi generally engage in monogamous relationships with no real preference toward any particular gender pairing. The height of intimacy for a kashrishi is opening their mind fully to the psychic link of another kashrishi, an act much more personal than anything physical. This act doesn't let kashrishi know whether someone is perfectly compatible with them or that the two mesh entirely—simply that from moment to moment, their inner feelings are more accessible and open, so communication becomes not a guessing game but an entirely wholesome, true experience. Some kashrishi believe that psychic communication should be held exclusively for these intimate moments.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi can be found in small groups on the island of Jalmeray and in larger communities occupying the many smaller islands surrounding it. Kashrishi in the Inner Sea region rarely venture beyond the Impossible Lands, though some of their oldest stories speak of a harrowing voyage across the Obari Ocean when their kind fled some long-past disaster.</p>\n<p>Kashrishi have no natural enemies. They host pirates and merchants with equal hospitality, so long as that hospitality is respected by their guests. While kashrishi are exceptionally tolerant of the quirks and foibles of other species, they draw a hard line at anyone bringing outside conflicts into their communities. More than one canny pirate captain docks their ship at a kashrishi island after a particularly heated conflict, knowing the pirate hunters and military vessels seeking them won't encroach on kashrishi lands. Escaped criminals hoping to find a new lease on life might also hide in a kashrishi community, doing whatever they can to assist their hosts until whoever is hunting them gives up the chase.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Most kashrishi are good, and almost instinctively kind because of their empathic abilities and tight-knit communities. Kashrishi are rarely interested in religion, though a few deities are more likely to be worshipped by kashrishi than others. Desna is known to kashrishi as \"The Crystal Butterfly,\" and when a kashrishi child goes missing, their parents might pray the Crystal Butterfly uses the light of her wings to guide the child home. Besmara is also unusually likely to be worshipped by kashrishi, though her dogma among them is essentially a splinter faith that focuses on her primacy over sea monsters and storms with little regard to the piratical teachings for which most other ancestries know the goddess.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>The empathic sense of a kashrishi has its own \"mental fingerprint\" that's unique to each member of the species, and this mental fingerprint can be conveyed through psychic communications as a name. Kashrishi who adventure with non-kashrishi often adopt descriptive names that their companions can more easily speak and remember.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Climber, Firehorn, Guardian, Healer, Lantern, Mother, Scout, Softhand, Tempest, Warrior</p>\n<h2>Kashrishi Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Kashrishi</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

This manifests as a general feeling of happiness, anger, or fear, without any specific details. For those with whom kashrishi have an emotional connection, physical touch can heighten this sense to greater degrees of detail and understanding, increasing with the strength of their bond.

        "Kitsune": {
          "name": "Kitsune",
          "text": "<p><em>Kitsune are a charismatic and witty people with a connection to the spiritual that grants them many magical abilities, chiefly the power to shapechange into other forms. Whether they pass unseen among other peoples or hold their tails high, kitsune are clever observers of the societies around them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Kitsune are shapechangers with two forms: one of a fox-headed humanoid and one largely depending on where they were raised. Those raised in populated areas typically have what's called a tailless form—a humanoid body without any fox features that resembles a more common ancestry, such as an elf or a human. In wooded or rural areas, their second form is more likely to be that of a fox.</p>\n<p>Though all-kitsune settlements exist, most live among people of other ancestries, granting them a degree of external insight into social rules or dynamics that others process only subconsciously. Kitsune enjoy subverting expectations as much as they do going along with them. Their fondness for jokes, stories, and wordplay, especially when the twist of a riddle hinges on the listener's assumptions, reinforces their reputation as tricksters.</p>\n<p>With dual forms and a connection to both the material and spiritual worlds, kitsune have diverse concepts of self and identity. Some even view their forms as separate individuals altogether, using them to explore different aspects of their personality.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with innate magical talents and countless hidden facets, each revealed with a glint of the eye and a twisting grin, you should play a kitsune.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Studiously observe the habits of those around you, taking mental notes on how to imitate them better.</li>\n<li>Delight in jokes, clever wordplay, pranks, or unnecessarily complex plots.</li>\n<li>Present a different, but authentic, side of yourself in each new situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are taken in by your magnetic personality and enigmatic nature.</li>\n<li>Marvel at your many supernatural abilities.</li>\n<li>Wonder what you aren't telling them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kitsune have alert vulpine ears, pointed snouts, and short, semi-retractable claws on their fingers and toes. Their fur is dense, countershaded, and most often red,tan, black, or white in color. Kitsune have bushy tails that grow in number as they hone their innate magical abilities, to as many as nine.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kitsune are rarely the majority in whatever communities they inhabit, and many go their whole lives without meeting another kitsune beyond their family. Their society, as much as it exists, centers primarily around the commonalities that kitsune find as they pass among other peoples. The same social perspective that helps them imitate others also makes them quick to notice signs that someone may need help or a kind word. Due to this, kitsune often form strong interpersonal relationships and tend to anchor their social circles.</p>\n<p>When two kitsune do meet, they may find themselves exchanging light verbal repartee, enjoying the sport of trying to outwit each other. While it's considered a grave offense to outright give away another kitsune's shapechanging nature, kitsune relish surreptitiously forcing another to \"break character,\" shocking the other into disrupting their transformation through a well-placed comment.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Kitsune often have neutrality in their alignment from balancing their dual natures, though their instinct for stirring up trouble leads many to lean slightly toward chaos. Some possess the ability to control or bend the will of others, but even among those that do, only the evilest use these arts flippantly or selfishly.</p>\n<p>The patron kitsune deity is Daikitsu, the goddess of crafting and agriculture. Though not all kitsune necessarily worship Daikitsu, most respect her as the purported source of their powers. Kitsune in Tian Xia often revere both Shizuru and Tsukiyo, seeing the duality of the sun and moon in their own multifaceted nature. A small sect of Avistani kitsune worship Sivanah, the goddess of illusion, respecting her position between perception and reality and believing the goddess's true form to be that of a kitsune-hidden behind not seven veils, but nine.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>While kitsune have some traditional names, they're more likely to use names that are unremarkable in their local society, the better to pass unnoticed. Some have different names for each form: a kitsune name for their kitsune form, a regional name for a tailless form, and possibly no name at all for a fox form.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Hamako, Haohiko, Kitsukou, Kon, Kwan-la, Talaro</p>\n<h2>Kitsune Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

Kholos are eminently practical and pragmatic hunters and raiders. To them, honor is just another word for pointless risk. Any loss of a kholo affects not just the individual, but their packmates and kin as well. Wasting time on anything but victory, whether it's mercy or cruelty, is seen as little shy of immoral. Kholos are masters of ambushes, tactical feints, and psychological warfare. Equally misunderstood is the kholo practice of ancestor worship and endocannibalism. Kholos consume their dead as a sign of reverence, holding a grand feast and transforming the bones into art or weapons. Kholos extend this honor to respected foes, hoping to bring their enemy's cunning or strength into the clan.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be physically demonstrative—hugging, punching, or licking your friends.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keep a bone from a favorite relative to ask for advice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intimidated by your size, teeth, and eerie laugh.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Respect the brutal efficiency of your hunting style.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kholo are hyena-like humanoids with short muzzles, sharp teeth, and large and expressive round ears.

Kholos typically stand between 6 and 7 feet tall. Women are usually about a head taller than men and correspondingly stronger. Kholos are considered adults at 15 and live about 60 years on average.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kholo generally live in semi-nomadic clans of 10 to 20 family groups, containing between 100 to 200 members. They are ruled by a council of female kholos who are typically selected from the elders of each family. Bonekeepers focus on tending to the wishes of kholo ancestors and gods—they take their name from the ancestral bones that festoon their clothing and homes. Storytellers serve as teachers and sages, and are expected to have an encyclopedic knowledge of clan history, regional lore, and anything else relevant to the clan.</p>\n<p>Newborn kholos are given a root name, typically that of a bone, plant, or animal (though never Hyena, as this is considered narcissistic).

Kobolds seek out these alliances out of a sense of pragmatism—after all, who would dare bully a kobold who serves an ancient dragon?—but also because kobold eggs incubated near such loci of power take on physical traits (and sometimes abilities) similar to those of the warren's benefactor. On their own, kobolds are ingenious crafters and devoted allies, but outsiders who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers and clever ambushers. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it's to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with deadly cunning and who bears the mark of a powerful benefactor, you should play a kobold.</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume that you are cowardly and won't stick around in the face of danger.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall), reptilian humanoids with slender bodies, long tails, and stout horns. Their features often reflect the nature of their warren's benefactor, such as vestigial draconic wings or glowing crystalline growths. These differences set warrens apart, though all kobolds are generally easily recognizable as such.</p>\n<p>Kobolds mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60. Some rare kobolds live even longer after harnessing the power of a magical benefactor.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable benefactor (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). Kobold societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by their benefactor's personality. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.</p>\n<p>A young kobold's given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, they might add more syllables to their names.

Leshies are self-sufficient from the moment the ritual ends, though it isn't uncommon for leshies to maintain lifelong bonds with their creators. Many leshies relish the opportunity to interact with the physical world.

Leshies begin their lives as adults and don't age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>To most leshies, the concept of family is not a matter of birth, but rather determined by bonds of loyalty and friendship. Leshies are dedicated allies, but they have little tolerance for those who would despoil nature. As much as they are happy to accept someone who earns their trust into their family, they expect family members to look out for them and their natural wards in return. Leshies are grouped into categories akin to ethnicities, but these are not connected to physical features; rather, they represent broad categories of characteristics of their spirits. Certain spirits are more likely to gravitate toward particular physical bodies, though this predisposition is far from absolute. Leshies' genders are determined by the spirits that inhabit their bodies. Some leshies are exclusively male or female, while many consider themselves both. Others, particularly fungus leshies, tend toward far more complex expressions of gender, or eschew the concept entirely.

          "text": "<p>Merfolk live in every ocean of Golarion, infinite in their variety and awe-inspiring in their majesty. They consider themselves, not without some merit, the rulers of the sea. Among the tropical reefs of the Fever Sea, merfolk build temples and palaces of brightly colored corals. Beneath the ice floes of the Shining Sea, merfolk hunt seals and whales for food in small, standoffish clans. In the Embaral Ocean, merfolk populate the great trading city of Alohmab, built into the shell of a titanic snail that crawls across the ocean floor.</p>\n<p>Though merfolk's everyday lives aren't all that different from those of the surface dwellers above, they have a much more intimate relationship with magic. In the aquatic environment of the open ocean, much that relies on fire and metal is impossible. Instead, merfolk shape sound and water with magic, using them as both tools and weapons. Such skills are widely distributed throughout all merfolk communities, even among those without formal magical training.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who embodies the grace, wonder, and danger of the sea, you should play a merfolk.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider magic a normal tool, something common and useful, rather than a sublime mystery.</li>\n<li>Have a sense of superiority when it comes to the water, whether that be arrogant disdain for anyone who swims or sails or parental concern that they might hurt themselves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are impressed by your musical and mystical talents.</li>\n<li>Assume that life beneath the waves is vastly different than life on the surface.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Merfolk are among the most distinct ancestries on Golarion; one can't really mistake a merfolk for anything else. From the waist up, merfolk have the bodies of humanoids with powerful bodies and sharp, aquadynamic features. Their eyes are a little larger than those of a human, and many have slightly pointed ears, similar to those of aiuvarins. Below the waist, merfolk have the bodies of great fish, each with a long, scaled tail ending in a fin or pair of fins.</p>\n<p>Merfolk come in every color of skin and scale imaginable. Most often, their human bodies have skin tones similar to those of humans or elves living in the same area—the merfolk of the Shackles, for instance, bear a certain similarity to the Lirgeni, while those who live in the Steaming Sea somewhat resemble their Ulfen neighbors. Merfolk who dwell farther from land take on colorations closer to fish tones of blue, gray, or even green. Deep-sea abyssal merfolk have dark gray, midnight blue, or even translucent skin.</p>\n<p>Merfolk fish tails are colored similarly to local fish populations. In the temperate zones where most merfolk live, they have iridescent, silvery bodies with traces of gray or blue; tropical merfolk might display patterns of brilliant colors, while those born in the depths might have translucent scales or faintly bioluminescent stripes.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Merfolk can be found in the corners of every ocean, but the largest concentration lives in sprawling aquatic kingdoms on continental shelves, usually in temperate waters teeming with fish. Merfolk look at the deep water in roughly the same way that surface dwellers look at mountains or deserts: some people can live there, but it isn't exactly ideal terrain. Merfolk territories consist of several settled villages and cities, sometimes organized under aristocratic families with courtly politics to rival those found in any Inner Sea monarchy. These political entities pursue active diplomacy with one another, making alliances and trade treaties. Many tend to be more standoffish toward surface dwellers, but some are fascinated by the surface and actively seek to learn about it, whether by using specialized water-filled mobility devices to come onshore or through ancient transformation magics.</p>\n<p>Merfolk value magic very highly, and any merfolk hoping to rise to a leadership role is expected to have a powerful grasp of the sorcery of wind, wave, and song. Merfolk kings and queens aren't necessarily the most powerful mages in their territories, but they're usually not far from it, as they have access to a wealth of teachings and artifacts passed down from one generation to the next.</p>\n<p>Merfolk have as many naming patterns as there are merfolk cultures, but a few tendencies predominate. Dolphin-like clicks and whale-like groans punctuate mellifluous merfolk names, and variances in pitch and tone help distinguish similar names from one another. Merfolk who regularly deal with surface dwellers often adopt names borrowed from local surface cultures, especially since merfolk names tend to sound strange and awkward to their own ears when pronounced in air rather than water.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aloori, Iri'kik, Ouliette, T'konaa, Uathanak</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>In general, merfolk follow the morals and customs of their parents and the communities in which they were raised. These vary greatly throughout the world. For instance, some merfolk are expected to live harmoniously with nature, while others follow a rigid set of laws ordained by their ancestors. Many merfolk believe that acts of altruism raise a community as a whole, even if they don't immediately produce beneficial results for the one who performed the deed in the first place.</p>\n<p>Merfolk worship is, like their societies, diverse. Deities with control over water are placed in high regard, and most communities have a shrine to Gozreh or one of the Elemental Lords of Water: Kelizandri or Lysianassa. Abadar is a popular god in some larger merfolk settlements, and a version of Erastil—more associated with sharks than with stags—is worshipped in smaller villages.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>aid one's neighbor whenever possible, bring the beauty of music to the world, protect the seas from threats within and without</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>fight the current head-on, use magic to harm innocents or hoard wealth</p>\n<h2>Merfolk Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 5 feet Swim 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Thalassic, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "Minotaur": {
          "name": "Minotaur",
          "text": "<p>Minotaurs stalk complex passageways, whether natural or artificial, and are masters of stone architecture. Inquisitive and steadfast, these bovine humanoids spend their lives perfecting the pursuit that calls to them, which can sometimes lead them far from the enclaves where they were raised. Minotaurs are originally from the Iblydos archipelago but have spread far and wide across Golarion, forming close-knit communities often near mountains or beneath the surface of the earth. Though sometimes mistaken for simple brutes, minotaurs have scholars and warriors alike. Those who can look past their appearance will find an affinity for building and navigation, as well as creative problem-solving.</p>\n<p>The myth many minotaurs tell of their origins is one of craft, curses, and misunderstanding. Millennia ago, Iblydos was filled with living deities who walked among and ruled the mortal people. A stonemason named Tavdrinos, admired by mortals and hero-gods alike, received a vision from a hero-god to create a glorious temple, though the myth doesn't name which one. The mason found the images of the vision murky: scrambled glimpses of twisting columns, charging bulls, and a defiant stand made by an unknown figure. It was hardly a detailed commission, but one does not refuse a divine order. The mason labored for 17 years before his task was done. The three-story temple celebrated the glory of the hero-god and their sacred animal, the bull. Upon the herogod's arrival, Tavdrinos expected to be met with praise and congratulations, but the deity flew into a rage instead. Tavdrinos had misunderstood the vision, for the bull was a hated beast, not a celebrated ally. As punishment for this accidental insult, the hero-god cursed Tavdrinos with the hated shape of the bull. Angered by both the curse and his failure to please the deity, the mason retreated to a series of caves under the temple, where he continued his work as the first minotaur.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with strength of body, who expresses themselves through craft more than words, you should play a minotaur.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Decorate your hooves and horns with designs or colors of personal significance.</li>\n<li>Be adept at navigation and puzzles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be intimidated by your size or think you calculating.</li>\n<li>Think you can see through stone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Minotaurs are tall, bulky humanoids with the bovine features such as horns, hooves, and elongated faces. Their fur patterns are frequently monotone in deep browns or blacks, though white or gray aren't uncommon. Though the large size of a minotaur might cause one think they are clumsy, the truth is quite the opposite. Minotaur hooves rest on a delicate balance point, making their footfalls quiet and precise. However, when there is a need to be heard, the steps of a minotaur can fall like thunder.</p>\n<p>A minotaur's horns are a source of pride and often accented by pieces of fashion. Those with longer horns add rings and chains around them, cast in whatever rare metals are affordable, or dye or engrave patterns along them. Those with not much horn to speak of instead shave their fur around the base of the horns, possibly adding stylish circular tattoos to the surrounding skin or fitting metal caps onto their tips. This draws attention to an otherwise overlooked feature.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Minotaurs typically reside within insular, subterranean communal enclaves. They take great pride in their architectural prowess, hewing buildings out of stone and natural caves alike. An enclave often has almost twice as many buildings as it needs, with the extra structures serving as functional art. Young minotaurs practice their hunting and stalking skills in the empty buildings, with each generation adding a small expansion or fresco on the walls. Expansions like twisting hallways, unexpected overhangs, shared gardens, and a variety of other such contrivances create numerous social spaces and quiet areas for calm reflection, so long as the traveler is able to keep from becoming lost by the unusual architectural flow.</p>\n<p>Myths surrounding minotaurs lead most to believe they are fierce carnivores, or even cannibals in the darkest of legends. In reality, most minotaur societies are hunter-gatherers, feeding off lichen and other flora. Their reputation as fierce hunters stems from monthly rituals, when the most accomplished stalkers venture out and bring back dangerous prey. The return of these hunters is one of the few occasions minotaurs indulge in meat, feasting on the kills as a show of gratitude and reverence for the hunters' skills.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs tend to be blunt and literal, rarely engaging in overly clever wordplay, sarcasm, or irony. Flaring nostrils and rolling eyes can be intimidating expressions when viewed by non-minotaurs, but to a minotaur, they can convey a complex story with emotional and even spiritual elements. Minotaurs wishing to emphasize a certain emotion occasionally use piercings and tattoos, though minotaurs who lean too heavily into these adornments to look fierce often come off as a bit foolish to their peers. The minotaur saying \"an angry bull stamps once and gores twice\" is both an admonition against overly aggressive displays and a reminder that the creature truly to be feared is one who speaks with their actions.</p>\n<p>Iblydan minotaurs often have names similar to the names of humans from that archipelago. Minotaur surnames are ever-changing, typically reflecting the most memorable achievement an individual has accomplished. Until adulthood, an Iblydan minotaur bears the surname Tavdrinos (after the first minotaur). Once they reach maturity, their childhood friends and allies collectively bestow a fitting surname. Minotaurs in adventuring groups might be renamed multiple times by their allies.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Actilea, Iraiasos, Paxaidio, Rotherion, Zavmandris</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Long traditions of isolation have resulted in most minotaurs taking an evenhanded approach to events. Many tend toward an unbiased outlook that allows for adaptation. Those who have poor interactions with other humanoids, particularly those met with violence or intolerance, might choose to recede into a chosen lair, ruin, or fortification that they guard fiercely, which sadly perpetuates the tales of brutal minotaurs.</p>\n<p>Minotaurs raised by their own people tend to avoid association with deities of any stripe—little surprise given their creation legend. Divine beings are thought of as petty and uncaring, if not by intent then by the sheer magnitude of their power. Many minotaurs adopt logical or spiritual philosophies as a way of reconciling their existence. Mysteries are puzzles yet unanswered, ones that can be explained with careful thought and study. When minotaurs decide to follow deities, they're primarily drawn to those concerned with self-improvement and self-control, like Irori and Nethys.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>construct architecture of lasting beauty, seek out ever more perplexing puzzles, hone one's prowess</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>leave fate to godly hands rather than mortal initiative, pass up the chance to investigate a mystery</p>\n<h2>Minotaur Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Jotun, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p>With humanoid figures and serpentine heads, nagaji are heralds, companions, and servitors of powerful nagas. They hold a deep reverence for holy areas and spiritual truths, an aspect many others find as intimidating as a nagaji's appearance.</p>\n<p>Nagaji are creations of the goddess Nalinivati, who was inspired by both humans and nagas. This inspiration, alongside nagaji's devotion to nagas, has led many to claim nagaji were created to be servants. However, Nalinivati created nagaji simply for the sake of creating. She envisioned a world where nagas and nagaji worked together to succeed, with nagas serving as sacred guardians, and nagaji living as mortals upon Golarion, respecting nagas for their strength and wisdom. Nagaji live up to this expectation, forming nations, temples, and villages with as many varied governments, societies, and traditions as there are scales on a serpent's back. If nagaji can be said to share any trait, it's devotion, be it to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most nagaji are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, even the darker aspects of philosophies and religions.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who combines the crushing strength and the sinuous mystery of a serpent, you should play a nagaji.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy the intersection of spirituality and everyday life.</li>\n<li>Have deep reserves of patience for tasks others might find boring.</li>\n<li>Adhere to strong beliefs and traditions about your place in the universe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you have no goals or interests beyond serving nagas.</li>\n<li>Find your unblinking eyes and serpentine features intimidating.</li>\n<li>Are awed by your connection and dedication to holy natural places.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Nagaji are prone to sharp differences in appearance. Some have tails alongside legs, some have sharp claws on their hands and feet, and some are so unique from their kin that they're mistaken for lamias rather than nagaji. The most common nagaji features are a serpentine head and a humanoid body. They usually have the unblinking eyes of a snake, though other peoples often claim a nagaji's gaze is far more intense. Scales cover nagaji bodies, with patterns that resemble those of snakes or nagas. Depending on their heritage, a nagaji's neck might be as long as a swan's or as short as a human's, and many have a frill of skin or scales down their back. Nagaji tend to possess crushing strength, but how it manifests can vary; some have bulky figures, while others have the slender yet powerful musculature of a snake.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Nagaji communities widely vary, from ancient empires to tiny fishing villages. They tend to be isolated from other peoples, more as a matter of convenience than choice; nagaji have different physical needs than most ancestries, so even when integrated into mixed communities, they tend to live with other nagaji. Everything from marriage traditions, religion, social roles, valued arts, and methods of governance differs in specific nagaji communities. Within these communities, however, nagaji often have very strict and traditional views on these topics. Multiple instances of wars between nagaji have come about due to one group of nagaji finding another's practices unacceptable. This perspective applies to relations with other peoples as well. For instance, most nagaji consider themselves rivals and enemies of garudas due to their historical legends, even if the nagaji involved have never even seen a garuda.</p>\n<p>Nagaji originated in the Tian Xia region of Nagajor. Though they have since spread across Golarion to regions such as Vudra and Jalmeray, many of them still carry traditions from their ancestral homeland. Tian and Vudrani concepts of elements, medicine, and spirituality are highly common among nagaji, especially given their tendency of seeing themselves as highly pious beings. Nagaji mostly eschew the human concept of castes, beyond the vague view of a \"natural order\" that sees nagas as holy guides to mortal nagaji, but they can see the appeal of the concept of karma and the righteousness of fulfilling their proper role in the universe. While they have little physical need for clothes, as they stick to hot and humid environments, nagaji wear them with pride and treat them as decorative elements in the same manner as jewelry.</p>\n<p>As nagas are usually matriarchal, nagaji have a strong respect for women in leadership positions. Not all nagaji follow suit with matriarchal societies, but they tend to trace lineage through the mother, and almost no nagaji societies are strictly patriarchal.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Nagaji are most commonly neutral but otherwise don't have any strong pull toward specific alignments. The presence of a naga can sway nagaji toward that naga's ethos, but a nagaji's view on life tends to be determined by the culture to which they belong.</p>\n<p>Nagaji overwhelmingly worship Nalinivati, their creator, to the point that any nagaji who pay homage to a different god over Nalinivati provoke strong negative reactions from their kin. While nagaji believe reverence for Ravithra, the supposed mother of nagas, to be proper and accept it more readily than other faiths, most believe Ravithra shouldn't be troubled with the requests of mortal adherents. A very small minority of nagaji in Jalmeray are drawn to the worship of the war god Diomazul; these adherents are tolerated by other nagaji, but seen as just as terrifying and dangerous as their patron god and usually avoided.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Nagaji names vary depending on what region of the world they occupy, but they tend to possess short vowels when they have any at all. Nagaji usually name themselves or allow groups of siblings to name each other as children, a tradition that often sees nagaji eagerly shedding these names for new ones when they reach adulthood.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Adesha, Garija, Kaya, Kuwana, Onok, Paravata, Sheni, Takasha, Tasi, Ulu, Vaski, Yulbin</p>\n<h2>Nagaji Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Nagaji</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p>Orcs are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born. As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, often by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance. Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest.</li>\n<li>View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as violent or lacking in discipline.</li>\n<li>Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Orc skin color is typically some shade of green, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.</p>\n<p>Orcs consider powerful builds, heavily scarred skin, large tusks, and tattoos attractive, regardless of gender. Orcs reach physical adulthood around the age of 17, with many orcs living to be up to 60 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most orc communities—known as holds—define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield. Additionally, power defines the dynamics among families and holds. Weaker orcs work at the behest of the strong, with power constantly shifting between orcs that prove their might. Orcs tend to share in familial duties, raising children as a community and sharing responsibilities among the entire hold.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Arkus, Durra, Grask, Grillgiss, Krugga, Mahja, Murdut, Ollak, Onyat, Thurk, Uirch, Unach</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>A common orc saying is \"you are the scars that shape you.\" Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend to expect and accept violence. Lamashtu, and Rovagug are commonly worshiped among more war-minded orc communities, while less violent holds worship gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.</p>\n<p>While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are often targets, rather than objects of reverence.

        "Poppet": {
          "name": "Poppet",
          "text": "<p><em>Poppets are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, poppets gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these poppets are free to chart their own destinies.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Most commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, poppets are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all poppets appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase poppets as toys, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most poppets can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Poppets can become familiars.</p>\n<p>Very, very rarely, a common poppet spontaneously manifests a spark of life-a tiny bit of life essence- and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A poppet might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the poppets described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.</p>\n<p>Sapient living poppets usually refer to themselves as \"awakened\" to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self‑awareness. Poppets might talk about this event as the time they \"popped up,\" \"woke up,\" or \"sparked alive.\" Most poppets celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most poppets, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Like surprising others with your unexpected cleverness and eloquence.</li>\n<li>Seek out other self-aware beings that most people might overlook.</li>\n<li>Rely on your harmless appearance to trick others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake you for a toy.</li>\n<li>Doubt your ability to handle tasks that require any dexterity or complex thought.</li>\n<li>Wonder whether your mundane form conceals other magical marvels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Living poppets are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, poppets burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.</p>\n<p>Poppets are fully alert and self‑aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Poppets don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A poppet that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Free‑willed poppets are so rare that almost no such poppet has met another. Poppets normally live with larger creatures, though not always their creators, and tend to get along well in societies sized for larger creatures. Most live in cities because that's where toy makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but poppets created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness. Poppets often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self‑awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or toys, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \"wakes up.\"</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Ordinary poppets are built as helpers and companions, and awakened poppets tend to retain this drive to aid others. They're therefore generally good, and more poppets are lawful than chaotic. Some spend their time trying to uncover secrets of their creation, find others like them, or keep out of trouble; these poppets are generally neutral in alignment. Poppets aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of Iomedaean altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred Gozren pool. These poppets tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Poppets who find religion later in their lives often revere Brigh, Casandalee, or Nethys.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Poppets generally choose their own names, usually descriptive nicknames based on their materials, patterns, size, or demeanor. They tend to pick up and shed nicknames throughout their lives, and they happily adopt nicknames given to them by people they like. A poppet fashioned to look like a particular person, such as a doll sewn to resemble a deceased child, might proudly take the name of that person.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Burlap, Buttoneyes, Checker, Clockwhirr, Fivestitch, Nettle, Scramble, Stuffing, Taffeta, Tattercap</p>\n<h2>Poppets of the Inner Sea</h2>\n<p>Awkward and endearing, poppets are well‑regarded in all but the most insular and superstitious communities of Golarion. They're known to be able, helpful, and loyal little creatures who support a master's work or make an aristocrat's life easier, which is particularly true in large trade cities such as Absalom, Almas, the city of Katapesh, and Katheer. The key difference between ordinary poppets and living poppets, in most people's experiences, is responsive speech. Ordinary poppets usually can't talk; if they can, they reproduce only a few preprogrammed phrases by rote. They normally communicate with strangers via notes pinned to their bodies, like walking note boards. Awakened poppets not only talk but carry on lengthy, expressive conversations, which likely strikes even the most jaded urbanite as a marvelous wonder.</p>\n<p>In regions where an entrenched nobility enjoys flaunting their wealth, poppets are even built specifically as toys. Taldor and Cheliax teem with aristocrats who pamper their children, grooming them for a life of leisure and devotion to family honor. These children have the best and most expensive toys, including poppets in fancy, frilly clothing. Such poppets are sometimes armed with subtle weaponry to fight against kidnappers or assassins who threaten their charges. Commoners in these nations treat poppets with deference and caution, as no one wants to risk the wrath of a spoiled scion. Awakened poppets from these lands sometimes believe themselves members of the aristocracy and can be snooty.</p>\n<p>In nations such as Nex, Osirion, and Katapesh, where magic flows freely, construct servitors are common. As many people expect to see familiars and homunculi in their daily routines, a busy poppet rarely draws much attention. Such poppets are assumed to be on tasks for powerful masters, but they don't command too much respect-after all, if the task were truly important, the master wouldn't have sent a simple poppet. Poppets in these regions can expect to have to wait in lines, pester trade workers to get their attention, or barter like anyone else. They also tend to have simple and functional appearances with few ornamentations and a tendency to look shabby from years of work. Thus, poppets from these lands have a deeper understanding of common folk from spending so much time shoulder to shoulder (or, more likely, shoulder to thigh) among them.</p>\n<p>Some poppets originate from crafted sophistication more so than magical skill. They might be cunning clockworks with interlocking piston‑powered gears or simply wood and wicker with ingenious hinges and well‑calibrated mechanisms inside. Others might look like toy soldiers or have visages of smooth, thin metal. Such poppets are most common in Alkenstar, Numeria, or around Absalom's Clockwork Cathedral. They often worry about rust, grit, or water spoiling their inner workings, to the point of being fussy.</p>\n<p>There are few areas where poppets are outright feared, but Ustalav is one of them. Whispered stories of ghosts or curses tell tales of common objects, or even toys, given dread animation to inflict misery on a household, making citizens highly suspicious of poppets. This belief is unfortunate because Ustalav has more than its share of the creatures; eccentric inventors, professors desperate to prove abstruse theories, and possessing spirits from beyond the grave might give a poppet the spark of life. These poppets learn caution quickly, lest they be thrown into a bonfire or lake.</p>\n<p>Because they're made from fragile materials, most poppets don't last very long before breaking down. A few rare exceptions survive from powerful ancient empires with well‑known mastery of constructs, such as the Azlanti Empire or the Jistka Imperium. These poppets might be incredibly old-older than they'll ever know, as such poppets awakened recently within an ancient ruin usually have no solid recollections of their creators or their original purpose. These poppets pose perhaps the deepest mysteries, as they might hold the keys to unlock secrets of lost civilizations.</p>\n<h2>Poppet Origins</h2>\n<p>It's rare to find two poppets that look alike, but the most significant and defining characteristic of a poppet isn't what they're made of. Rather, it's how they were imbued with life and independent thought. Magic animates most poppets, and those awakened gain their spark of life and sentience when something goes slightly off‑kilter with their enchantment. For unknown reasons-perhaps an accident or a creator's errant tinkering-a spark of life explodes into being, and a formerly lifeless series of nested commands and calculations synthesize together as true thought. The poppet suddenly gains life and self‑awareness, the ability to speak and reason, and a desire for freedom.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a poppet's life essence originally belonged to another being. An errant fragment of a departed soul, psychic impression, or similar ephemeral sliver lodges within the little construct, and the poppet's magic fashions an entirely unique personality around it. A poppet awakened this way might have occasional glimpses into the being who donated this essence, but their life, mind, and soul are thereafter their own.</p>\n<p>The rarest, and perhaps most precious, poppets are brought to life with love. These are faithful assistants or beloved toys that someone earnestly, honestly wished would become \"real.\" There's more magic in the world than found in formulas and litanies, and this wish magic awakens poppets in the best of circumstances: knowing they're cherished and able to respond with love of their own.</p>\n<h2>Poppet Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

If they can't find homes in town, ratfolk may instead live in caves and cavern complexes, as these provide great storage for the many and varied goods they bring back from trading expeditions.</p>\n<p>Ratfolk love to travel, and they can often be found on the road in merchant caravans. They're good with their hands and have a keen eye for spotting anything out of the ordinary, from threats to treasures. They're also inveterate hoarders; ysoki warrens are crammed full of unusual odds and ends gathered by previous generations and stowed away in preparation for some future emergency.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is smart, fast, welltraveled, and adaptable, try playing a ratfolk!</p>\n<h2>You might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have pride in your large extended family, and stay in contact with everyone in it.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Like to travel near and far in search of new experiences, likely collecting trinkets along the way</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are surprised by your careful grooming and other fastidious habits.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Think you're crowding them and invading their personal space.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Ratfolk have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, and typically have red eyes and short brown or black fur. A common ratfolk is 4 feet tall and weighs around 80 pounds. Ratfolk vary considerably, however; even a single family group can exhibit substantial variation in hair color, eye color, or size.</p>\n<p>Instinct drives ratfolk to maintain cleanliness, though this is also reinforced through their strong social structures. Because their appearance is often considered disturbing by other humanoids—and people may even mistake them for wererats—ratfolk often conceal their physical features with layers of clothing when moving through spaces dominated by other ancestries.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Ysoki culture values cooperation and community. Every ratfolk learns—through communal games, social occasions, and sports—to forge fast friendships and connections with ratfolk outside their family. With a long tradition of working as traders and tinkers, ratfolk travel frequently from one town to another. Their wagons are usually grouped into caravans of up to half a dozen vehicles. Ysoki wagons are pulled by exceptionally large giant rats, and many ratfolk can speak to such animals.</p>\n<p>Every ysoki family has perhaps two dozen names that have been passed down from generation to generation, sometimes with minor alterations or alternative nicknames. Ratfolk are often assigned nicknames and sobriquets by humanoids they interact with, but most find these names distasteful and endure them only when outside their communities.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Barnan, Chikis, Chonan, Deto, Jass, Jix, Knagi, Kubi, Lolo, Ninnec, Nos, Rak, Renzi, Skigim, Tali, Zess</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Ratfolk care more about their family than abstract concepts of good and evil. Their warrens might be chaotic dens filled with hoarded knickknacks, but they also obey strict social codes.</p>\n<p>Though ratfolk revere their ancestors and tend to acknowledge whatever deity is prevalent in their local area, Lao Shu Po has a special role in ysoki culture. Grandmother Rat embodies many things that are otherwise antithetical to ratfolk—she urges followers to put their own interests above others. To most ratfolk, Grandmother Rat accomplishes all those things they need done, but which they would not wish to do.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>put your community's interests above your own, maintain a cleanly appearance, be honest in your dealings</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>throw away something that might be useful</p>\n<h2>Ratfolk Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Ysoki, Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Samsaran": {
          "name": "Samsaran",
          "text": "<p>Samsarans, as the tale goes, originated with a group of scholars in Zi Ha who ventured into the mountains to find the cure for an illness ravaging their village. After weeks of peril, they found a freshwater spring filled with pure magical life essence. This water brought the scholars back from the brink of death and cured the villagers. Given a new chance at life, everyone who drank the water devoted the rest of their life to learning and experiencing the world fully. Upon death, this devotion, combined with the magical essence now infused in their bodies, transformed these people into the first samsarans.</p>\n<p>Samsarans dedicate themselves to achieving enlightenment—a true understanding of everything and everyone in the world around and beyond them. Unlike duskwalkers, samsarans reincarnate many times over, with some accumulating thousands of lived lives. This cycle of reincarnation continues until the individual samsaran achieves this goal of enlightenment, or irrevocably fails at making any progress toward it. At that time, a samsaran's soul passes onto the Great Beyond, and their body melts into pure water. For those samsarans who succeeded at enlightenment, they find a time of peace and satisfaction in the afterlife. Those who have failed instead encounter an afterlife filled with misery, punishment, reminders of past failure, or in extreme cases, nothing, leaving the souls to waste away for the rest of time.</p>\n<p>While samsarans can recall parts of their past incarnations, these recollections often feel like halfremembered dreams. By combining these snippets of memories from the past with new knowledge from their current life span, samsarans can view and connect with the world in entirely unique ways. The detachment that comes with countless lifetimes sometimes makes it difficult for samsarans to empathize and connect with others, however.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who experiences a repeated cycle of existence, seeking out new knowledge and experiences as you walk a path to learning everything you can about the universe, you should play a samsaran.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be single-minded toward a goal to complete the next step of your enlightenment.</li>\n<li>Have a deep sense of curiosity for other people and their perspectives.</li>\n<li>Take things at a slower pace, putting things off until the next cycle of reincarnation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think that you're very knowledgeable and wise.</li>\n<li>Assume that you're deeply spiritual and detached from worldly matters.</li>\n<li>Consider you immortal and envy your ability to reincarnate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Samsarans reflect the diversity of whatever ancestry they had in their first mortal life cycle, and only upon their first rebirth do they take on the unique features of their kind. The reincarnation cycle gives samsarans blue skin tones, often in a pale shade but ranging to the deepest midnight navy as well. They have pupilless eyes that are typically pallid in coloration, comparable to the moon. Samsarans also have transparent and colorless blood, resembling crystal clear water.</p>\n<p>When samsarans die, they reincarnate as a baby born to a humanoid couple of non-samsaran ancestry, often in the area a particular samsaran held the most affinity for in their previous life cycle. While they might share some features with their previous incarnation, the similarity is more like the shared appearances between a parent and child rather than identical duplication. Samsarans age at the same rate as humans, and unless they succumb to unnatural causes of death, they die of old age at 100 years old. Children born to samsarans live their first life cycle as the mortal ancestry their parents had and will take on the unique skin color and eyes of other samsarans only after their first death.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The ultimate goal for samsarans is to reach enlightenment, but there's no singular path to walk or prescribed way to do so. Rather, each samsaran must explore the universe and learn its many secrets in their own way. Some samsarans find their way into schools, where they study niche research topics for decades at a time. Others act in the service of different gods, each religion offering them guidance to understanding the universe. Many enter periods of long internal reflection, isolating themselves from the outside world, while a handful venture out into the world to experience everything firsthand. From one incarnation to another, a samsaran can also switch up their path, pursuing a new avenue of knowledge and experience than they'd done for the last few centuries.</p>\n<p>Even with the independent nature of the path to enlightenment, samsarans don't necessarily go through their journeys alone. Samsarans value community as spaces to share knowledge, find support and safety, and establish a connection with similarly minded people. Samsaran communities are often tightly knit, and their enclaves small. With a focus on knowledge and connection to the world, these samsaran enclaves typically occur in schools and temples. Trusted non-samsarans are invited into these communities to share their expertise and to learn from the collective knowledge of samsarans in different stages of the enlightenment journey. Conflicting perspectives and experiences are welcome, with samsarans encouraged to talk through differences to come to a better combined understanding.</p>\n<p>When samsarans travel outside of their enclaves, they often live nomadically until they find something they want to study. If their journey takes them to a non-samsaran community, they might spend several cycles learning and experiencing life within that community, lending their knowledge to the people there and becoming a member until the call of enlightenment leads them away.</p>\n<p>Rarely do samsarans have children, but when they do, the child isn't born a samsaran. Rather, the child bears the ancestry of their parents before they too reincarnated into samsarans, such as a human child born to samsarans who were human in their first life. Thus, it's tradition for children of samsaran lineage who haven't gone through their first rebirth to be adopted by nonsamsaran communities and experience a fully mortal life. This practice isn't done out of cruelty or neglect; most samsarans believe that spending this first lifetime among one's kin is a fundamental element that can never be properly experienced after reincarnation. Some samsarans do choose to raise their children themselves, but they usually keep members of their child's ancestry as close friends to maintain the important connection in this first lifetime. Regardless of their upbringing, once the child dies and reincarnates for the first time, their parents will traditionally bring the child into a samsaran community to begin their path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>While a core part of a samsaran's identity is preserved in the reincarnation cycle, their gender, appearance, and perspectives change from incarnation to incarnation. Even with memories shared between life cycles, when a samsaran is reborn, they're treated as a different individual than their previous incarnations.</p>\n<p>For samsarans, the journey is the destination, so they don't rush through their lifetimes trying to reach enlightenment as quickly as possible. Every incarnation, a samsaran usually focuses on a goal that will further their understanding of the world. However, if the goal isn't accomplished in one lifetime, it gets carried over into the next reincarnation cycle, with some goals lasting several hundred years. The blending of lifetimes combined with the fact that the reincarnation cycle continues indefinitely until enlightenment is achieved—or failed—gives samsarans a skewed sense of time. With as many lifetimes as they could possibly need to accomplish or undo anything they want, urgency isn't a common concept for samsarans.</p>\n<p>Samsaran names are shaped both by their previous incarnations and their present one. Their first names are given to them by the parents who raised them in their current life cycle and therefore reflect the region and culture where they're reborn. Upon reaching adulthood, samsarans give themselves a second name that reflects what they learned in their previous incarnation or represents their goal for this life cycle, such as virtues they hope to embody or concepts they wish to better understand. Most samsarans don't use traditional surnames, but if they wish to have one, they often combine the names from their last two incarnations.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altuin Nurture, Davare Clarity, Enkhma Defense, Jochi Spellcrafter, Narintya Softheart, Sarange Lawseeker</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>With their lives centered around seeking enlightenment and the laws of the reincarnation cycle, many samsarans tend toward structure and order, tempered by compassion and empathy drawn from existences spent in a variety of bodies. A samsaran's beliefs can also change between incarnations, with the experiences of the previous lifetime impacting their worldviews in the current one.</p>\n<p>Many samsarans are drawn toward religion and deities, which provide community and a framework to understanding the world that helps guide their path to enlightenment. With each samsaran's path being so independently unique, samsarans might follow any of a wide variety of gods in any given lifetime. However, Tsukiyo is often cited as the patron god of samsarans since many samsarans feel kinship toward his own tale of rebirth and the eternal cycle of the moon. Some tales even suggest that Tsukiyo had blessed the magical springs the first samsarans drank from.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>achieve greater self-understanding, find your personal path toward enlightenment, take your time on journeys</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>live without intention or purpose, prevent others from genuine attempts at learning, stagnate in thought or passion</p>\n<h2>Samsaran Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon, Common in Zi Ha, Po Li, and Goka</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Samsaran, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Sarangay are carabao-headed people who have long survived deep in the forests across Tian Xia. Many adventurers have thought them to be monsters at first, but sarangay are nothing more than a thriving society who value their community and their souls above all else. Their cultures are built upon the intense desire to protect their communities and their chosen leader. Their horns are said to be a crescent moon, and their towering statures are said to have come from their ancestors being stretched so far up to reach their Father Moon while their Mother Earth kept them close to her bosom. They revere the great Father Moon, their First Ancestor, and endeavor to protect and exalt nature above all else, for they understand that they're part of it.</p>\n<p>Sarangay tend to be rare and appear even rarer within the diverse confines of adventuring cities. When they leave their society, it's typically because they either have a duty to fulfill or they must depart in order to save their community. In the rising chaos of the modern lands of Tian Xia, more sarangay have begun to venture out into the world, either preemptively investigating potential threats or facing a breakdown in their own societies. The most tragic sarangay are those who wander alone because they have nothing and no one to protect and care for.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is at home in the wild, possesses inherent occult power, is sharply aware of their impressive strength, and comes from a proud culture, you should play a sarangay.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<p>Show off your head gem to loved ones but hide it from those that you don't trust.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exalt a warrior culture that focuses on protecting what's yours as well as the forests and lands around your settlements.</li>\n<li>Be overly protective of those you care about, even to violent ends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are circumspect about the topic of your head gem, either out of empathetic respect or scheming greed.</li>\n<li>Trust your word when you say you would protect the ones you love.</li>\n<li>Underestimate just how gentle you can be when it comes to those you care for.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Sarangay are tall warriors with humanoid bodies that almost always have naturally heavy builds. They average at about 6 to 7 feet tall and have visibly muscular physiques—sarangay very often describe humans and similarly built ancestries as \"slender\" due to the difference between their typical figures. Their eyes are black orbs with white crescents for pupils. They have large, clawed hands, while their legs end in hooves that have the capacity to topple trees. Sarangay reach adulthood when their horns reach 2 feet in length. Their jewelry tends to include large horn platings, nose rings, and excessively large bangles made of gold common in the forests where sarangay live.</p>\n<p>From birth, every sarangay has a giant gleaming stone upon their brow known as their head gem, which houses their soul. When sarangay choose a partner, they switch their head gems with each other and are in love for the rest of their lives. Unsurprisingly, sarangay are belligerent against anyone who would steal these gems. Unfortunately, the size, quality, and rarity of the head gems give them a staggering market value, and their spiritual associations attract unscrupulous magicians.</p>\n<p>Callous nobles of Tian Xia love to carve such gems into decorations or display the gems upon their desks and in their lavish living areas.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Sarangay are strong individually, but together, they're considered unbeatable. Most sarangay communities are small villages deep within the forests, but they demonstrate the same amount of diversity as the other ancestries of Tian Xia. These settlements are built out of houses that can be easily destroyed and remade; these residences can be moved with the shifting seasons and tides, to avoid invaders and other threats, and to uphold the proper geomancy of a village. The center of a village is always the house of the village chief, usually known as the datu, or sometimes ratu. The datu's house is known as the kraton, a large multi-storied palace made of the best hardwood, lacquered and oiled, making it less disposable than the other houses.</p>\n<p>The datu is surrounded in their daily lives by their closest companions, usually either their own kin or a coterie of vassals who are indebted to the datu and are obliged to fight as the datu's own warband of faithful knights. Those sarangay related to the datu are often known as nobles, and they can take on any profession of their liking. The rest of the village is made up of commoners who do a large amount of the work for the village. They render a part of their labor to the datu in return for the protection and prestige of the datu's stewardship. This hierarchy isn't mandated by some divinity, but rather out of respect for a worthy leader. Datu who are deemed unworthy by the rest of the village are often overthrown by the concerted efforts of the commoners, who then choose a better datu, who can even come from their own ranks.</p>\n<p>Sarangay hold their gleaming head gems in the highest regard, for the gems are said to contain their souls and all their memories. If a sarangay's gem is destroyed, it can regrow through the help of a shaman's ritual, but the gem-less sarangay falls into a state of dreamless stupor until then. Entire warbands are formed in villages to protect against poachers and adventurers who would steal head gems to achieve untold riches.</p>\n<p>Sarangay usually have names that are two to three syllables long and that are usually one or two words, depending on the cadence. They tend to have consonants paired together to create hard yet regal sounds that exalt the ancient tongue and names of their ancestors.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Dakal, Davvun, Karatallu, Kasta, Kunnasi, Makkan Vulan, Mangi Yavu, Mappia, Nallutu, Ngatta, Nikanni, Sikamu, Tadday, Tullung, Uzzin, Vulu Vvuga</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Despite their inherent occult powers, sarangay are very attuned to the forces of nature and the rhythms of wild places. They particularly hold the moon, which they call Ama Vulan—Father Moon—in the highest regard. Sarangay believe their horns represent the moon in its crescent phase, and their head gem is the moon at its fullest. During the full moon, sarangay perform intricate rituals to earn merit and favor from Father Moon, whom they believe to be their First Ancestor. Other than Father Moon and Mother Earth, they pay proper reverence to the thousand little gods who live in the leaves, in the droplets of water, in the embers of a bonfire. Sarangay believe that nature is inherently divine and alive, living much like they do.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>protect what's yours, seek to understand the duality of the earth and moon, spend time enjoying the rhythms of nature</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>betray a worthy leader, remove your head gem without good cause</p>\n<h2>Sarangay Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaws</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Though shisks can't fly, these spines are longer around their arms, as if they once had wings. A shisk's eyes contract into slits in the sunlight and are typically warmly colored, from hazel and brown to more unique colors like red or amber. Shisks have two prominent narrow fangs as the front teeth on their upper jaw, causing some people to mistake them for asanbosams or vampires.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Though rarely encountered, shisks are willing to speak, host, and trade with outsiders. Their economy might be confusing to others: they greatly eschew materialism in favor of information and the arts. They freely give away material goods for knowledge or even performances, considering themselves on the \"winning\" side of a bargain if people are willing to take material things in exchange for valuable information. They never give away information for material goods, only for other knowledge, and they rarely ask for material goods in trades.</p>\n<p>Shisk are so paranoid that different communities of shisks have been known to clash with one another over secrets. Wars are fought not over territory or resources, but over coveted information. On a few occasions, when shisk sages or diplomats convinced different groups of shisks to put aside their differences and collaborate, great puzzles and mysteries of Golarion have been solved in a matter of hours.</p>\n<p>Shisk clothing is loose and breathable, and often minimal to avoid catching on their bony feathers. Due to their society's disregard for materialism, the shisk live in great harmony with nature around them, taking only what they need. Shisk often take up simple hobbies, such as sunbathing.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Seeing themselves as part of the natural world and typically focused on their own pursuits instead of society, most shisks adopt neutral alignments. Some shisks are patrons of gods that have been long forgotten. Many shisks worship the sun god Chohar, a fact which might seem odd for people who dwell underground. The Green Faith is highly common among shisks, but when seeking out personal gods to revere, most shisks prefer gods of knowledge and secrets such as Irez, Nethys, or Norgorber.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Shisk names are usually granted by their parents, though these names often have secret meanings known only to their families. They are often filled with sibilant syllables, occasionally punctuated by sharp vowels.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Adomssha, Asjossa, Chishinsa, Dalissho, Lessia, Lishassha, Somissu, Quinshu</p>\n<h2>Shisk Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Mwangi, Shisk</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Diminutive humanoids who resemble squat, bipedal dogs, shoonies are sometimes mistaken for weak and insular pacifists. However, their sheer perseverance, incredible work ethic, and resourceful use of diplomacy make shoonies far from helpless.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>According to shoonies, Aroden created their kind to provide him with pleasant company soon after he created the Isle of Kortos. Shoony culture is rooted in this myth and its implications, which help to explain the ancestry's long reputation for hospitality, good will, and pacifism. War is antithetical to the shoony way of life; shoonies rely on cooperation and persistence to make their way through a world that can seem at times hellbent on destroying them. Shoonies are unflappable in their optimism and always see the best in others, even when faced with frequent subjugation and exploitation that might create bitterness or xenophobia among other societies. To shoonies, peace is a goal always worth striving for, and no villain is beyond redemption, so they aim to resolve problems with peaceful solutions.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fight to protect those you care about and strive to do the right thing.</li>\n<li>Work hard for long hours in a focused pursuit of distant goals.</li>\n<li>Provide comfort, necessities such as food, and a sense of kinship to those in distress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Involuntarily fawn over (or recoil from) your physical appearance.</li>\n<li>Protect you from scary situations or terrifying phenomena, out of either friendship or overprotectiveness.</li>\n<li>Appreciate your pragmatism and natural ability to care for others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Shoonies are squat, furry humanoids with flattened canid faces and wet, black eyes. Their fur can be a variety of hues and patterns, with the most common colors being fawn or black, and their loose skin gives even the fittest shoony a pudgy appearance. Shoonies have short, curly tails that sometimes wag involuntarily when the shoony is content or particularly excited or pleased. Like canines, shoonies cannot sweat; they pant to mitigate heat and exertion, and it is not uncommon to see a shoony with a perpetually lolling tongue.</p>\n<p>A shoony reaches maturity after just 8 to 10 years, and the elders of their villages rarely reach the age of 50. Little differentiates male and female shoonies except during the late stages of pregnancy, and as they age, both sexes develop graying facial fur, wrinkled skin, and frail joints. The average shoony is 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Despite the shoony drive toward communal living, most shoony settlements are farming villages with populations of no more than a hundred. Shoonies work hard to make their lands bountiful and recognize that large, dense populations can negatively affect the ecosystem. Monster attacks, natural disasters, and exploitation from stronger cultures have all also limited the spread of shoonies across the Inner Sea region.</p>\n<p>Despite their short lifespans, shoonies are happy-go-lucky people with an irrepressible love for the land and their fellow shoonies, and remain optimistic even under the worst circumstances. The simple pleasures of living on this beautiful world, engaging in hard work, and surrounding themselves with loved ones motivate shoonies to push through the hardships that all too often befall their people.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Most shoony societies encourage empathy and loyalty, so they're rarely evil, but they're also practical, traditional, and timid. Most shoony adventurers are neutral good or lawful good. Religion is a cornerstone of shoony village life; shoonies primarily worshipped Aroden until his apparent death. In his absence, many shoonies have adopted Erastil as their patron deity because his emphasis on family, community, and living off the land naturally meshes with typical shoony values. Noble shoonies-especially warriors-sometimes look to Iomedae as an exemplar of integrity, hard work, and sacrifice.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Few shoonies willingly choose to leave their homeland and friends in favor of facing the unknown, and the circumstances that lead a shoony to adventure are often dramatic and life-altering, if not tragic. That said, some shoonies do travel the world in search of riches to bring back to their village or to avenge their kinfolk, and shoony adventurers who show bravery or ingenuity are sure to earn a place in the legends of their people.</p>\n<p>Typical shoonies have the acolyte, farmhand, hunter, laborer, or warrior backgrounds, or the animal wrangler or rigger backgrounds. Many shoony adventurers are fighters who hone their skills to become stalwart defenders of their friends. Some shoonies pursue religious study and become clerics or champions, while others develop their foraging and hunting skills as talented druids and rangers.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>With their strong family values and emphasis on found friends, it's no wonder that shoonies take particular pride in naming their children after other loved ones. Shoony names are short, guttural, and often sound like loose strings of unassociated vowels and soft consonants to people of other ancestries. Shoonies value names and take great care to learn and speak the correct pronunciations of their friends' names.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ahogo, Arnbin, Bighmor, Bondin, Domwurd, Ebmeur, Gopor, Gurna, Hiemgur, Mufurlo, Oriog, Pulumar, Raliamar, Ruggion, Uhulrig, Ungrin.</p>\n<h2>Shoony Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shoony</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Skeletons are considered among the lowest types of undead. They're typically mindless creatures, lacking many of the abilities that make other undead a serious threat. However, the animated bones of dragons, giants, and other great beasts make for dangerous foes. Powerful living creatures can retain some of their might and intellect upon returning as a skeleton. Some necromancers turn their strongest enemies into skeletal undead servants, assuming they can keep control of them.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Skeleton adventurers were usually skilled and powerful in their former lives. Through unremitting force of will or extraordinary circumstances, their ego and ideals persist even in death. However, the very act of rising as a skeletal undead is traumatic. Memories of one's former life are usually fractured or hazy, if anything can be remembered at all. For some, these memories return with time; for others, they're gone forever. For the most part, this comes down to how the skeleton views themself: either as a continuation of the person they once were, or an entirely new being.</p>\n<p>Skeleton adventurers often set themselves apart from other skeletons by dressing as flamboyantly as their station allows. Large, feathered caps, ornate armor, embroidered silks, or glittering jewelry are likely staples of their wardrobe. Some carve intricate \"tattoos\" into their bones or paint their skulls to maintain a sense of self that simple skeletons lack, and to signal to the living they're not like other undead.</p>\n<p>Skeleton adventurers must come to terms with their new identity. They aren't bound by the limitations of the living and are often underestimated.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work harder than most to prove you're a capable and distinct individual.</li>\n<li>Wade into danger with little regard for the safety of your undead body.</li>\n<li>Desperately seek the acceptance of the society you once moved through with ease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you're the servant of a necromancer, working to advance their agenda.</li>\n<li>Have difficulty empathizing with you.</li>\n<li>Regard your undeath with either pity or envy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Aside from their complete lack of flesh and organs, skeletons vary widely in appearance, reflecting the broad diversity of all living beings. They can be tall, short, or anywhere in between. Skeletons of creatures with horns, wings, or tails retain them, although they are usually useless in their skeletal state. Skeletons raised from fresh remains tend to have stark white bones, while older ones tend to be gray or yellowed. Skeletons who adventure for a while often possess faint lines crisscrossing their bones like scars, indicating where they were injured in previous battles.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Across Golarion, intelligent skeletons rarely gather in large enough numbers to constitute any kind of settlement. Even in Geb, where their numbers are highest, they typically mingle with other undead rather than band together. Many skeletons would rather keep company with those who remind them of their former life (although such reminders can just as easily lead to revulsion derived by the void energy infused within them). Gebbite skeletons are usually treated as members of the servant class and rarely have any upward social mobility.</p>\n<p>Outside Geb, skeletons are far more solitary. Some might hide on the outskirts of society or move about in disguise, but it's difficult for them to find acceptance among the living. While they may not be feared in places like Nidal or Sekamina, they're also not likely to be respected.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>While undead are almost always evil, some intelligent skeletons manage to stave off the corruption of the void energy that powers them. Other than the tendency to become twisted toward evil over time, skeletons typically lean toward the alignments of their creators or their former selves. Skeletons without any particular loyalty or allegiance trend toward neutral evil alignment, or neutral if they can stave off evil.</p>\n<p>Skeletons who embrace their undeath often worship gods of death, such as Urgathoa, while those who resent it typically look toward gods of life and redemption. Accepting deities without particularly zealous anti-undead dogma, such as Shelyn, are popular among those who wish to fight against their destructive influences and become something greater than the purpose for which they were created.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>No widespread naming convention exists for skeletons. When necromancers bother to name skeletons they've raised, they typically choose names that suit their own tastes, the way one would name a pet. Others might be named for their role or job. Skeletons with their memories intact might choose to keep their name from when they were alive, but others might choose new names based on their undead experiences.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Clatterjaw, Creaker, Doorstop, Final Sacrifice, Gochiyo, Lectern, Macefodder, Sixth Lancer, Skulldyr, Xelim</p>\n<h2>Skeleton Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Necril</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p><em>Sprites are diminutive, whimsical, and exuberant creatures from the fey realm known as the First World. They love playing pranks, exploring new things, and embracing everything to do with magic.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>When most people picture a fey, chances are they're thinking of a sprite. The majority of sprites remain in the First World, where they are essentially immortal, reincarnating to a new form of fey when their life eventually comes to an end. Some even meld together with others to form a more substantial body or split apart into multiple smaller fey. However, sprites are incredibly curious about all forms of magic, leading a significant number to risk the mortal world to explore the new possibilities offered by the unusually static nature of mortal existence. These creatures mix in with other, smaller groups of Material Plane comrades, including exiles from the First World, those whose family swore pacts to mortals, and even contemplative individuals curious to enter the mortal cycle of souls.</p>\n<p>The first generation of Material Plane sprites were content to guard magical locations or objects, learn music, and play pranks on the unsuspecting. Panic struck when children born in the mortal world didn't form wings upon adulthood-some sprites transitioning to the mortal world likewise lost their wings after a time. Believing this to be a sign that the mortal world was too alien for them to live there, many of the initial sprite explorers returned to the safety of the First World.</p>\n<p>However, their wingless children exhibited a potential unmatched by any of their ancestors, as well as a particular magical affinity for the mortal world. They became the mightiest of sprite heroes, but also, on occasion, the most dangerous villains. As they came close to reaching their full strength, many of them did grow their wings at long last: larger, unique, and more vibrant than any from the First World had seen before, a sign of their limitless potential.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is tiny, mercurial, and curious, you should play a sprite.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Play good-natured pranks on those around you, intended to teach a lesson, aid in locating a lost item, or even help find love.</li>\n<li>Become sidetracked by something new and eye-catching before you have fully followed through on your previous plan.</li>\n<li>Find something magical that's so important to you, you can't help but protect it with every ounce of your strength.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expect you to know strange fey mysteries and perform fantastical primal magic well beyond your actual abilities.</li>\n<li>Consider you the prime suspect whenever unexplained hijinks or serendipity comes their way.</li>\n<li>Misconstrue the way your mind works, seeing your flitting attention as a sign of being scatterbrained.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Sprites are tiny faeries whose features vary wildly based on their heritage. The Wingless-those with the potential to become powerful heroes and villains, including all PC sprites-slowly grow their wings over time as their magical potential manifests, though some never grow wings at all. Those sprites with humbler destinies typically grow wings when reaching full adulthood and mastering their innate magic. Sprites reach adulthood at around the same rate as humans do, but a typical fey who can manage to stay out of mischief and danger can live 1,000 years or more. Material Plane sprites who sense their time is coming to an end usually return to the First World to be reborn and start their adventure all over again.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Sprites habitually live in tiny, reclusive villages in areas with abundant magic, natural beauty, or other curiosities of interest. Other sprites live as loners or with small family or peer groups, traveling across the land in search of excitement.</p>\n<h2>Alignments and Religion</h2>\n<p>Sprites run the gamut of alignments but are rarely lawful or evil. They are far more likely to worship the Eldest-the peculiar deities of the fey-than those of the mortal world. They have a particular affinity for Shyka, the many-formed Eldest of time, and the Lantern King, the trickster among their ranks. Among mortal deities, sprites appreciate Desna the most, and due to her iconic depiction as a butterfly-winged woman, some Desnan sprites claim her as one of their own. Sprites also readily comprehend the doctrines of Cayden Cailean and Shelyn, and the goddess of beauty and art is a particular favorite among grigs.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Sprite names are based entirely on their parents' whimsy. Sprites often adopt additional monikers later in life or change those assigned to them at birth; this is neither frowned upon nor considered abnormal.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Bree, Plumgrass, Cowrie, Flit, Moth, Zephyr, Naatalu, Pinebrush, Zandivar</p>\n<h2>Sprite Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Tiny</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Sylvan</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

With an average height of 6 feet, strix are taller than most humans but are very light for their size. Strix are considered mature at 14 years of age and have an average lifespan of 40 years. They have pointed ears and large eyes that are typically black from sclera to pupil, but occasionally appear as a piercing golden color. Strix lack the ability to move their eyes independently of their head, resulting in distinctive jerky movements as their gaze snaps between targets. Their bodies are usually taut with defined musculature-a result of the strength necessary to flex their wings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Strix are rare and reclusive people who cling to their ancestral territories. They live in modest-sized tribes, but some reside in smaller bands of tight-knit individuals. The largest settlements of strix reside on Devil's Perch, but a small number of their ilk have traveled far across Golarion. Strix feel an intense empathy and attachment to their family and other community members. They prioritize the needs of their community over their individual desires, and their bands and tribes benefit from an easy yet expertly organized division of labor. Strix tribes are led by a rokoa, a female tribal leader.</p>\n<p>A long history of conflict with the nearby nation of Cheliax as bred into most strix a deep fear and suspicion of humans-who they call kotaara. Strix have struggled to keep hold of their territories and maintain their numbers in the face of constant conflict with these enemies who, in addition to trying to destroy what they believe to be winged devils, vastly outnumber them. Due to their strongly bonded groups, the loss of a single tribe member is devastating.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Due to their deep respect for the rules of a functioning society, strix are rarely chaotic, but some may be flexible on adopting the rules of outside societies. Strix are typically nonreligious and instead use stories from an epic known as the Korrsat Akra, or \"The Scattered Nest,\" to tell them of their origins and give them direction on their current place in the world. They have a deep investment in the lives of their fellows and experience intense grief at their passing. Pharasma is a common influence among religious strix due to the popularity of religious and spiritual practices honoring the lives and deaths in their beloved community. Gozreh is also an everyday influence for many strix, who beseech the Wind and the Waves to give them satisfying tailwinds for flight and protect their kin when the sky turns dark with fury. Erastil and even Torag represent two versions of social order and may be unifying deities across entire tribes.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Strix names consist of sounds that are reminiscent of chirping, screeches, or trilling by various birds, and their naming conventions are influenced primarily by tradition and spirituality. Strix in small communities might share a common syllable among all their names to express their unity. Due to their deep affection for their family members, naming children after other loved ones is very common, occasionally with an additional syllable or slight change to the pronunciation.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Chiit-iir, Cicreeti, Ikatarii, Irkoata, Kaata, Kiilo, Kirii, Rahka, Roatatwiil, Turiilo, Turuk, Twilii</p>\n<h2>Strix Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Strix</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

As a subterranean species native to the Darklands, surkis have rarely been seen on the surface, and always with long pauses between historical sightings. This is due to surkis' life cycle—long dormancies followed by so-called \"generation digs,\" as they migrate great distances in response to happenings underground. The healing of the Worldwound initiated one of the largest such digs in their history, bringing surkis up into the caverns and passages of the Sarkoris Scar and emerging onto the surface for the first time in many years. Since their emergence, several small surki settlements have been established in secluded corners of Sarkoris, voraciously cataloging the wildlife, magics, and various other inhabitants of the area as they explore the alien environment of the surface.</p>\n<p>Rather than consuming food conventionally, surkis are filter feeders, absorbing magic from the air, soil, plants, stone, and practically any other material. This magic is refined and sequestered in nodes throughout a surki's body over the course of their life cycle, which is comprised of three distinct phases: larva, adult, and evolved. At each stage, surkis use their stockpiled magic to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis into their next stage of life, evolving adaptations that will help them survive in any environment. Surkis therefore vary dramatically on an individual level; each surki tells the story of their adventures and their chosen role in the environment in their unique combination of adaptations.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who's exploring Golarion for the first time, with limitless adaptability and a strong tie to magic, you should play a surki.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Feel a very strong connection to the world around you, sensing the latent magic in everything.</li>\n<li>Be driven to travel far or learn as much as you can about your home.</li>\n<li>Pay particular attention to the way others live in environments unfamiliar to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistake your individuality and excitement for your adaptations as boastful pride.</li>\n<li>Find your excitement for new people, places, and things endearing and inspirational.</li>\n<li>Trust your magical senses over their own maps in tight situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Each of surkis' three life stages greatly differ. Larval surkis spend the first 10 to 100 years of their lives dormant inside their eggs, waiting to emerge when they've accumulated enough latent magic and the environmental conditions are just right. Larval surkis are roughly two feet long and grub-like with several luminescent nodes visible through their translucent flesh. Their heads are chitinous, round, and eyeless, and they navigate primarily using the ability to smell magic. Four of their six legs are small, but the front set are large, powerful digging claws that they use to tunnel through the earth and to communicate with the other larvae in their generation dig as they travel from their nest home. Once they've traveled far and accumulated enough magic, they enter a cocoon for several days, emerging as the adult form that's seen most often on the surface.</p>\n<p>Adult surkis have a roughly bipedal form, standing on two multi-jointed limbs and having two arms that end in three-fingered claws used both for digging and for producing percussive sounds used in the Surki language. They possess two feathery antennae and two long sensory barbels that sit on either side of their mandibles. Surkis have a characteristic rounded shape with several rustbrown or orange chitinous plates along their back, and surki clothing and fashion tend to incorporate rounded shapes or belts around and under their plates. Their magical nodes are distributed throughout their bodies, clustering in the abdomen, shoulders, and each limb.</p>\n<p>These nodes continue to accumulate magic as they age, using it to create new adaptations, often heralded by intricate, luminescent patterns in the chitin surrounding the point of change.</p>\n<p>The final stage in surkis' life cycle is known as the evolved form, after the surki enters its grand metamorphosis. An adult surki forms a chrysalis and rapidly changes over the course of a single evening. Less physically dramatic than the shift between larva and adulthood, the evolved form brings with it profound magical abilities that resulted from a lifetime of magical absorption and refinement. Evolved surkis' nodes metamorphose into complex organs capable of projecting tangible magic to a variety of ends, from digging apparatuses made out of pure force to glowing wings that defy gravity. This final form is the ultimate expression of any surki's individuality and adaptations—a form perfectly suited to fulfill the environment they choose to inhabit or the role they wish to fill.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Surki society places great importance on individuality and self-expression. Every surki is expected to find their own way of doing things, and innovation is a highly prized achievement. Surkis are also very much in touch with their environment; they place no distinction between plant and animal, recognizing that every being fills an important part of the environment. This quality has led surkis to create settlements that leave as little impact on the environment as possible, weaving silks around plants and fungi to coax them to grow into shelters and walls. Wood and other plant-based resources are seldom harvested in a manner considered traditional to most societies in Golarion. These resources are portioned out in strategically grown sections and harvested precisely enough to not kill the plant if possible.</p>\n<p>Surki relationships are focused on complementing adaptations. Surkis are generally polyamorous and might maintain a close bond with numerous others. Surkis are a single-sex species, and while they understand concepts of gender and orientation as experienced by other ancestries, many surkis find the idea of choosing not to bond with someone based on anatomy or personal descriptions absurd. They instead choose to pursue those with personalities, talents, or adaptations that augment their own in unexpected ways, such as using woven silks to reinforce a tunnel dug through loose rock. Nevertheless, attraction in surki society is as complicated an idea as in any other, and bonded surkis will often express their feelings toward a loved one with a personal description that expresses something they value within the relationship. For example, a surki might introduce a partner as \"Who Speaks Quietly and Makes My Soil Richer.\"</p>\n<p>Only adult surkis are capable of reproducing, which they do through parthenogenesis. Any adult surki can lay an egg when they choose, though because the process expends so much of the magic stored in their nodes, few surkis lay more than one egg every few years. Many of these eggs are kept in a protected area of the settlement, awaiting the next generation dig. When the eggs are ready, they hatch en masse, and the larva coordinate their departure, drawn to magic like a beacon tunneling through the earth and stone to find a new place to settle.</p>\n<p>Familial life vastly differs for surkis. Eggs lain outside of a generation dig are cared for and tended by the surki \"parent\" until the grub emerges. New village grubs are typically left to their own devices, allowed to venture outside the village or even leave the community altogether. Often, village grubs find their first homes in the soil of the community farms, where they feed on the natural magic within the soil and plant life. These gardens double as schools for these grubs, as the adult and evolved surkis who tend the gardens regularly converse with the grubs, thumping and scraping out the stories of their young lives and the lessons they've learned from others. Surki grubs born early or those whose nodes don't function well are often bonded with ostillis, small amorphous symbiotes that augment the grubs' ability to absorb nutrients from magic.</p>\n<p>Surkis choose their names when they enter adolescence. Every surki has a name referred to as their \"root\" or \"grub\" name that's produced solely with the forelimbs. Adults commonly incorporate all or part of their root name preceding their chosen name, though it isn't expected to be repeated, especially by those of other ancestries who don't possess the exoskeleton necessary to \"pronounce\" the name. The root name, while shown proudly, is considered the personal property of the surki who possesses it, and repetition of the root portion of a surki's name is considered rude by most, tantamount to theft. Surkis' chosen names typically represent a personal quality that they admire most or an achievement they take pride in. As surkis age, they might change their chosen name to better fit who they feel they've become. When surkis die, any present-tense verbs used in their names become past tense.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Bearer of Heavy Boulders, Weaver of Intricate Webs, With the Deftest Song, Who Shines Brightly, Whose Patterns are Bold, Whose Voice is Music</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Surkis' connection to their environment leads them to typically worship natural deities. Their own ancient traditions identify each creature as possessing a unique spirit, with keystone species occupying a deific role within their ecosystem. Surki traditions dictate that surkis and other cultures aren't part of this spirit cycle, though with time, care, and practice, one can be accepted into it with the blessing of the environment's keystone species.</p>\n<p>Among surki communities in Sarkoris, worship of Gozreh and Sturovenen has grown quickly. Surkis who dedicate themselves to a deity are more likely to choose one representing their own environment or the natural world as a whole. Deities whose domains include travel or change are also popular among surki devotees.</p>\n<p>It's very important to surkis that life be allowed to follow its natural course.

          "name": "Tanuki",
          "text": "<p>Tian Xia is replete with magically gifted ancestries—such as tengu, kitsune, yakshas, and yaoguai—whose powers bring them high regard and who, in turn, use their gifts for responsible ends. Tanuki aren't one of these ancestries. Instead, the shapeshifting raccoon dog–like humanoids use their powers of illusion and transformation in ways more people should: for fun! Tanuki delight in pranks and practical jokes, especially those that allow them to take the high and mighty down a notch and show them what life is like for everyone else. Where other peoples take pride in their storied histories, noble traditions, or intricate ceremonies, tanuki take pride in their simplicity and disregard for the world's many rules. Though some might claim this outlook reduces tanuki to uncouth rubes, tanuki feel it makes them more cultured; after all, one must know a rule to bend it, and one must understand a norm to break it.</p>\n<p>That being said, their laid-back natures can cause tanuki, and others, no end of trouble. Their focus on living in the moment can often mean they're brought low by a problem they could've solved earlier with little effort. At the end of the day, tanuki rarely come out on top, and even their victories tend to be mixed with small defeats or embarrassment. A tanuki bard might save the day with the power of his music, but only because he played so off-key that bandits mistook him for a fearsome ghost. Tanuki are usually just fine with such an outcome, though. There's a truth to the world that tanuki know in their bellies: that the ups and downs of life are all just a big joke, and if everyone's going to be made a fool in the end, you might as well be the fool who gets to dance and have fun along the way! Life's a party, and tanuki intend to enjoy it as much as they can before their luck inevitably runs out.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who loves to have fun—occasionally at another's or your own expense— who's always up for a party and perhaps a bit too clever for their own good, you should play a tanuki.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live life to the absolute fullest, getting into whatever trouble that approach might bring you.</li>\n<li>Take pride in your duties and accomplishments, no matter how humble.</li>\n<li>Be accustomed to the role of underdog and take it in stride, seeing failure as a wonderful punchline.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find you the life of any party.</li>\n<li>Know you'll always have their back.</li>\n<li>Hope you aren't about to play a joke on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Tanuki are short humanoids who resemble bipedal raccoon dogs, usually growing between 3 and 4 feet tall. They tend to have rotund bodies, with large bellies that appear even wider due to their thick fur. A tanuki's face is likewise round, with wide-set, alert eyes outlined within a dark mask of fur. Tanuki have a single bushy tail that they take great pride in and to which they ascribe their powers. These qualities together give tanuki a strong cultural appreciation for rounded shapes over sharp angles, such as daruma dolls, circular doors, and the moon.</p>\n<p>Tanuki often wear simple, rustic clothing, opting for plain garb over elegant frills or shining jewels. However, tanuki are known to go all-out for festivals and similar celebrations, which they see as the perfect opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest. Many tanuki make it a point to always carry a red vest and dancing towel in case an impromptu party breaks out.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Tanuki know that, among the many people of Golarion, they're underdogs, possessing neither the mastery of the heavens that tengu command nor the divine favor that kitsune enjoy. All things considered, tanuki know they have to support each other, building tight communities where everyone knows each other's names. These communities tend to exist on the outskirts of villages, often in abandoned warehouses or farms or else near temples and other public buildings. When tanuki societies overlap with those of other peoples, they usually function unseen with their own codes of honor, rarely noticed by those in power.</p>\n<p>Tanuki love celebration and will hold any number of parties for even the smallest accomplishments—a project such as building a new bridge might have a kick-off ceremony, a toast when the plans are decided, a morale lunch when the workers have assembled, a banquet upon finishing the bridge, and a festival to dance over the bridge when it opens to the public. This proclivity is sometimes brought up as a reason for why tanuki endeavors tend to take an interminably long time (with some failing spectacularly along the way), but tanuki feel that it's important to celebrate what small victories they can. Besides, the community bonds forged among the participants are as much a part of the project as the actual building itself.</p>\n<p>Tanuki tend toward unglamorous names with functional meanings, such as those that describe a tanuki's birth order or the weather or season on the day they were born. Tanuki surnames tend to be similar, describing either their family's profession or location in a town. These conventions make tanuki names feel relatively old-fashioned, though some avant-garde tanuki give their children (or themself) a grandiose name in defiance of their traditional station.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ame, Chiyo, Chosuke, Hinata, Mari, Nao, Saya, Taro, Terao, Rei, Ichiro, Jiro, Saburo, Shiro, Satsuki, Mutsu, Nanami, Hazuki</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Tanuki count no member of the Celestial Court among their own—a fact they see as further evidence that they have to stick up for each other since there's no tanuki deity looking out for them—but they find themselves drawn toward gods such as Kofusachi, whose boisterous and compassionate approach to life they consider aspirational. Though tanuki hold deep reverence toward the moon, they tend not to worship Tsukiyo, knowing he finds loud worship agitating, and they take care to not invoke his name or imagery during harvest moon or lunar new year celebrations to ensure their cheers and belly drums don't draw his attention. Tanuki with Inner Sea cultural traditions tend to revere Cayden Cailean, seeing the blood of a tanuki in his commoner status (and drunken accomplishments), with some tanuki statues even depicting Cayden with a big belly and leaf atop his head to suggest that he was simply a tanuki in human form, tricking the Avistani even to this day.</p>\n<p>Tanuki generally use their powers to humble the rich and snobby; at the very least, they create illusions with no more evil in their hearts than a simple joke (or a free meal taken from one who can afford it), rather than acting out of malice. However, there are some tanuki do harbor resentment, which can take root and fester in their hearts. These tanuki turn to cruel ends, known for all manner of nefarious deeds, chief among them cooking their enemies into soups or stews once they've finished tricking them.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>Choose excitement over stability, let bygones be bygones, make your community laugh</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>Feel entitled to social status, prank one of lower means than yourself, wallow in your failures</p>\n<h2>Tanuki Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon, Tanuki are common in Minkai, the Forest of Spirits, and Goka.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Tanuki</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

If you want to play a character who embodies the struggle between self-betterment and self-expression, you should play a vanara.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find it difficult to avoid pursuing a mystery or exploring a hidden area.</li>\n<li>Thoughtfully consider the consequences of your pranks or actions.</li>\n<li>Enjoy sharing the knowledge of things you've discovered with your friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you have an animalistic demeanor and habits.</li>\n<li>Take a dismissive or hostile view of your pranks.</li>\n<li>Covet your easy grace and unquenchable curiosity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Vanaras are humanoids with simian features, including a long, prehensile tail and handlike feet. They're rarely much taller than 5 feet, but they usually look smaller because of their slight, nimble builds. Vanaras are covered with a thin layer of soft fur over their entire bodies. This fur can be tan, brown, or golden and rarely has spots or stripes. The hair on a vanara's head grows thicker and more luxurious; it's easy to arrange into elaborate hairstyles, and many vanaras like to do so. This hair is nearly always of the same color as the vanara's body fur, with the exception of rare \"whitecape\" vanaras with manes of fine, pale hair, who might be born into any vanara family. Vanaras have large, expressive eyes and mouths with blunt teeth and pointed incisors. Vanaras are adults at 13 years old and usually live about 60 years.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Vanaras are a varied folk who seek balance and comfort in their lives. Many are devout without being fanatics, tricksters without being malicious, daring without being foolish, and curious without being obsessive. Although aware of their deep ancestral connection to Ragdya, many vanaras feel a powerful desire to live beyond the grace of their god and his weight in their history, pursuing their own paths to enlightenment. Those vanaras who live in Vudra feel this need the most strongly, as they want to pursue virtue and self-knowledge to be fulfilled when their souls are next reborn into the world.</p>\n<p>Although created by Ragdya, vanaras feel themselves apart from him in a way some find uncomfortable. Ragdya is the eternal trickster with supreme recklessness yet unchanging in his immortal permanence. Though most vanaras cherish Ragdya's mischief and feats of folly on religious holidays, they also know he shall never fade from this world or find himself reincarnated into forms other than that from which the vanaras were shaped. Yet, vanaras aren't so immutable. A vanara must reflect on their own impermanent nature and consider its effect on their soul and their soul's quest for enlightenment. For all the mischief and daring Ragdya might enjoy without consequence, vanaras know recklessness and harmful tricks can impede their personal pursuit of enlightenment. The drive toward mischief and spontaneity instilled within them by their creator is hard for many vanaras to overcome and can create a lifetime of internal turmoil. This source of conflict has colored their development as a people who seek balance and virtue.</p>\n<p>Vanaras look to the legends of heroic vanaras of the past for lessons on how to live their lives. The most notable and lauded accomplishment of these legendary vanaras, that which has them known even in the most far-flung ashram in the snow-capped border mountains of Vudra, was their grand act of trickery against Ravana, the greatest of all the rakshasa immortals. Ravana had tyrannically forced many noble souls, vanara and human alike, to construct a resplendent bridge of azure stones that would cross the planes from Vudra to the rakshasa's realm. Ravana demanded that each stone be carved to display a mewling visage of the mortal who toiled to cut and shape it. Through mischief and artifice, vanaras altered the carvings so that, when assembled, they subtly displayed components of a prayer to all the Vudrani pantheon. When the bridge was finally finished and Ravana marched across it with his army of fiends in a profligate parade, the shuddering of the stones beneath their footsteps mimicked the movements of the communal prayer. Deities drawn by this display toppled the immortal maharajah, and he still blames mischief-making vanaras for this humiliation. Many vanaras thus see it as their legacy to bring shame to the wicked and powerful by means of clever tricks and communal effort.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Vanaras are tricksters who love pranks, but they temper this tendency toward mischief with good intentions and a love of their community—however they personally define that community. They're rarely agitators or troublemakers simply for the sake of causing chaos; they do so to encourage humility among the inflexible or humorless. Most vanaras are mindful of the virtues necessary to elevate their immortal souls and try to act accordingly. Vanaras are thus most likely to be neutral good.</p>\n<p>Most vanaras live in Vudra, where they're exposed to the dizzyingly abundant array of Vudran deities. Nevertheless, devout vanaras nearly always venerate Ragdya above all others. Priests of Ragdya lead most vanara villages. Even vanaras who aren't religious might call upon Ragdya to help them make wise decisions in times of danger or for guidance when an unlucky prank has caused them trouble they're unsure how to escape. Vanaras interested in developing self-control might worship Irori instead, and regions with local vanara hero-gods or avatars might engender faithful sects of worshippers on a small scale. Some vanaras revere the evil simian hunter Lahkgya, but almost never openly, as this deity of ferocious and sudden violence is unwelcome in most vanara communities. Some communities instead make offerings to turn Lahkgya's attention from them.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Newborn vanaras aren't given names other than descriptors of their infant personalities or habits, like \"Grip-Hand\" or \"Wailer.\" When they learn to speak, vanaras are given another name based on important historical or mythological figures, or they're given the name of a specific ancestor they resemble in appearance or attitude (or whom their community hopes they'll grow to resemble). The chosen name usually contains consonants or vowels the young vanara frequently uses, as vanaras don't see a lot of use in giving someone a name they can't easily pronounce.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ashpaka, Chichipi, Haangeno, Hasa, Huanu, Kana, Nammem, Roprutu, Thathona, Unulu, Vivatu</p>\n<h2>Vanara Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Uncommon</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vanaran</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Vishkanyas are ophidian humanoids who carry potent venom within their blood and saliva. Largely misunderstood due to old tales of their toxicity and natural finesse, vishkanyas work to grow into more than just what stories paint them to be.</p>\n<p>The true nature of vishkanyas' origin is a matter of debate. Some vishkanyas believe they are rejected spawn of Ravithra, which explains the animosity between vishkanyas and nagas. Others believe themselves the stolen offspring of a forgotten progenitor whose name was excised from history. Regardless, one thing is quite clear: vishkanyas are survivors. Throughout history, fear of their deadly abilities forced vishkanyas to experience subjugation, exploitation, and ostracizing. Yet through it all, they endured. Now free of chains to bind them, vishkanyas live in close-knit groups, and use their love of storytelling and the arts to keep a detailed history of their people while they determine how best to proceed in a world ripe with opportunity.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a powerful sense of community.</li>\n<li>Find peace and fulfillment in having a creative pursuit.</li>\n<li>Be adept at matching the environment around you to fit into any number of diverse situations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Initially mistake you for having a tiefling or draconic heritage.</li>\n<li>Think you are an expert in poisons, toxins, and espionage.</li>\n<li>Misunderstand the nature of your venom and fear physical contact.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Vishkanyas are humanlike in appearance with ophidian features that become clear in close proximity. They are naturally tall and lithe with bright golden eyes, vertical pupils, and a forked tongue. Their small, smooth scales range from earthy tones of browns and greens to bright displays of colored patterns. Hair color is typically of darker shades, though there are occasional instances of brighter colors through parts of the hair. Vishkanyan women are usually taller than the men, though neither ever truly stops growing. As such, vishkanyas can reach heights of 7 feet or taller in old age.</p>\n<p>Mixed vishkanya families aren't unknown. Vishkanya offspring from this background sometimes strongly resemble their non-vishkanya parent, with only a few stray tells, such as sharp canine teeth, to indicate their heritage. Vishkanyas sometimes refer to these children as \"scaleless\" or \"subtle\" but otherwise welcome them as any other among their kin, though sadly their appearance can fuel paranoia among other ancestries toward a people who are already misunderstood.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Vishkanyas live in small, tight-knit communities between 50 and 100 individuals who assimilate discreetly into larger societies, with many such groups scattered within a larger area. At the head of these groups is a selection of women chosen for their wisdom and knowledge. Vishkanyas often have multiple partners, give birth in multiples, and adhere to maternal inheritances. Children are generally free to choose their occupation and the nature of their contribution to the larger community, with many vishkanyas pursuing some sort of craft or art. Some roles are burdened with the responsibility of cultural and historical record-keeping, however, and these important tasks continue across generations. Traditionally, these culturally minded vishkanyas regularly meet in secret congregations for the purpose of sharing stories, information, and resources, providing support for youth and creating advisory bodies to help make large-scale decisions for vishkanyas of a given area. The desire to preserve vishkanyan culture has kept this practice going for centuries, yet recently, some have called for more open interaction with the world in an attempt to proudly share vishkanyan culture.</p>\n<p>Vishkanyas are often mischaracterized as indiscriminately venomous or inherently malicious by other ancestries, which has led to them having very strong concepts of their own ethnicity and their separation from those they consider \"outsiders.\" While most vishkanyas are gracious and hospitable to non-vishkanya visitors, a large stir often arises around the concept of allowing such people into their communities in a more involved capacity. Parents carefully watch any children who seem too attached to non-vishkanya friends, and talk of romance and marriage with another ancestry will inevitably provoke many a long family discussion—though not necessarily hostile ones.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and religion</h2>\n<p>Concerned mainly with the preservation of their communities, vishkanyas tend to adopt neutral alignments. Vishkanyas who take to individualistic travel to teach others about their ancestry, or simply to experience the world, might be neutral or chaotic good. The topic of faith can be quite different among vishkanyan groups, with some sticking to old vishkanyan beliefs, and some to Vudrani deities like Likha or Ashukharma. Other groups outside Vudra might embrace local gods with tenets of freedom or the arts, such as Arazni, Cayden Cailean, or Shelyn, or divinities more specific to individual pursuits.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Vishkanyan names often include short vowel sounds in the middle of the name, with a large number of fricative consonants pronounced most accurately with a forked tongue. Names are often chosen from momentous events in vishkanyan history or from matters related to the maternal line of the child. When they go through significant life events, vishkanyas may choose new names for themselves, and many often do so multiple times. Each name represents an important part of the individual's story—who they were, and who they have become.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ashath, Casuthis of Guiding Hands, Enysi, Izith, Othasee, Riddle of Esaviz, Salthazar, Thasi the Ragebreaker</p>\n<h2>Vishkanya Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vishkanya</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "Wayang": {
          "name": "Wayang",
          "text": "<p>Wayangs are diasporic sojourners from the Netherworld where they lived and worked alongside their allies, lightweaving d'ziriaks. Both peoples shared affinities for artistic expression and spiritual introspection, inspiring each other's sensitivities to color, form, and function; they also bolstered each other's defense against rampaging dragons, oni, and undead. This idyll collapsed from divine meddling; some say when Abadar sentenced Zon-Kuthon to exile in the Netherworld, the Midnight Lord's deific presence distorted the plane into a nightmarish domain, while others accounts ascribe fiendish sources to this doom.</p>\n<p>Whatever the reason, wayang and d'ziriak communities suffered terribly; Kuthites and velstracs colonized the Netherworld, engulfing it in religious wars of slaughter and brutality—an ongoing catastrophe that wayangs and d'ziriaks refer to as the Desecration. Despite both peoples' valorous resistance, with every generation, space and resources became scarcer. When the Age of Ashes created passageways between the Netherworld and Golarion, many wayangs sailed away for a better life.</p>\n<p>These curious wayfarers became Tian Xia's first wayangs, who shared their skills and labor to eke out a solidarity of subsistence with Earthfall's survivors. These explorers also observed how Tian Xia's suffering souls weakened barriers to the Netherworld, whose malignant overlords absorbed the negative emotions to grow in power. While disappointments, melancholia, and other negative experiences were part and parcel of existence, the engineers of the Desecration exploited mortal emotions to oppress both the Universe and its shadow Netherworlds.</p>\n<p>Realizing these planar interconnections, wayang leaders reached a bold conclusion: no world is free until all worlds are. To prevent the Netherworlds' colonial oppressors from harnessing mortal souls and to reclaim the darkness from its present state of malice and anguish, more wayang expeditions arrived in Tian Xia with exorcists and cursebreakers to purify paths to the Netherworld and starve its despots of spiritual power. Toward this end, wayang sages devised the Dissolution, a philosophy of drawing strength and peace from one's inner darkness. They shared their teachings discreetly with those in Tian Xia touched by darkness, instead of leaving such people to be preyed upon by velstracs and other depraved entities.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is at home in the shadows of Tian Xia's oceans and jungles, is heir to mystic and martial arts drawing upon the Netherworld's untainted power, and pursues obscure struggles against dark forces, you should play a wayang.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out Tian Xia's dark places, such as mountainous caves, shaded mangroves, or rainforest canopies.</li>\n<li>Be curious about this sunlit world, so different from your home's occluded vistas, and seek out new experiences to inspire your artistic expressions and meditative introspection.</li>\n<li>Dream and work toward a time when your people can overthrow your invasive masters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you creative and seek to commission you as an artisan or appraiser.</li>\n<li>Fail to understand your people's motives and distant struggles.</li>\n<li>Whisper frightful rumors about your origins and attribute curses to your presence.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The rigors of an interplanar struggle and life on or near the seas of Tian Xia grant many wayangs wiry frames, and many carry themselves with a gravitas that belies their small stature. Despite long journeys under cloudless skies, wayangs' skin (ranging from ivory white to duskwood black) doesn't sunburn easily, a blessing attributed to the darkness's love for its children. Thick shadows flit and dance almost like a second layer of skin upon wayang bodies, sheltering them from the sun's glare. Wayangs further decorate their skin with intricate patterns of paint, which non-wayangs often misinterpret as scarification or tattoos. With concentration and training, wayangs can move their shadows independently of their body, an ability that both warriors and storytellers use to great effect, either in aiding their ambushes or illustrating their performances. Wayangs tend to grow their hair long, construct elaborate headdresses of shell and horn to hold their hair up in immaculate hairstyles, and favor long scarves or shawls over their shoulders.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Wayang society encompasses many tensions between communal and individualistic behaviors. While wayangs organize themselves into collectives modeled after agrarian villages or seafaring crews where everyone has to do their part for the shared betterment, hermits and iconoclasts are also afforded special places in wayang society. While individual wayang villages or ships might look to their leaders for direction in everyday matters, these leaders in turn also look to solitary gurus and unconventional visionaries for guidance and inspiration.</p>\n<p>The wayang political universe is composed of multiple overlapping mandalas, concentrations of influence around central charismatic and powerful figures, such as experienced chieftains, ingenious artisans, or intrepid captains. In turn, these individual concentrations cohere around yet other figures famed for righteousness or wisdom, such as sagacious teachers, virtuous princes, or masterful occultists. This approach to social power is useful for organizing diverse diasporas scattered across islands and planes; each collective practices sufficient independence to pursue their own journeys while retaining enough interdependence to respond to others' calls for help and friendship.</p>\n<p>Wayang interactions with other communities usually take place as visiting artisans bearing handcrafted goods of precious materials and exquisite quality. Beyond their aesthetic appeal, these items also provide potent supernatural protection against fiends and undead. Despite the high demand, wayangs don't sell them, but instead offer them freely only to those blessed by shadows, such as particular sorcerer bloodlines. Wayang emissaries use these gifts to aid potential allies and strengthen them against other forces of darkness. In time, many also hope to instruct their newfound friends in the secrets of the Dissolution and call upon their strength to overcome the Desecration.</p>\n<p>Wayang names combine Tian-Sing, Minatan, and Vudrani elements, hints to the vast distances they've traveled. Names also tend toward the allegorically evocative, alluding to the names of places, gods, ancestors, and lineages. Few wayangs named after gods adhere to those deities' teachings, however, a fact that's infuriating to etymologists and theologians. Such supernatural names are instead chosen for their prestige and power, not piety—a practical decision for outsiders seeking protection and power in an unusual land.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Putri Rubah Hebat, Hakim Gunung Api, Raja Ribut Hitam, Adik Musang</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>It's common for a people with such long histories of alliances and respect for community to abide respectfully within society. Wayang society also has positive perceptions toward less pragmatic individuals; many resourceful wayang explorers and artisans embrace attitudes of curiosity and free-spiritedness. Life in darkness teaches the value of skepticism while discouraging moral absolutism or extremism. Wayangs are seldom cruel, perhaps as conscious rejections of the Desecration. Though few champion great causes, many practice quiet benevolence and empathy for those also suffering from oppression or cruelty.</p>\n<p>Wayang religion is largely syncretic, incorporating Iroran austerities of meditation and self-mastery, Sangpotshi and Pharasman metaphysics of planar transmigration, and beliefs in the Netherworld's indigenous spirits and ancestors. Gods are generally seen as tutelary spirits who can help individual supplicants gain supernatural power. In particular, many invoke Lao Shu Po, whom wayangs call Sister Mousedeer. Her cleverness and ability to outmaneuver more powerful divinities and repurpose their power proves especially inspiring to anti-colonial efforts. Ascetics seeking power and wisdom also emulate Ragdya and Diomazul. Notably, despite valuing community and civilization, few worship Abadar due to his place in condemning the Netherworld to Zon-Kuthon's debasement. Ironically, some fallen wayangs have become Kuthite adherents and now strive to capture and torment their former fellows.

        "Yaksha": {
          "name": "Yaksha",
          "text": "<p>Away from shining citadels and opulent palaces, reticent yakshas shelter Tian Xia's rural hinterlands from natural disasters and otherworldly depredations. Famed for resolute vows and prowess with primal magic, yakshas shield the indigent and protect the wilderness, punishing those who threaten either with bone-crushing fury. Yaksha legends recall their origins as divine spirits, overseeing the safety of roads and abodes in a primeval world of vast storm forests and titanic flame floods—the First World, a realm of boundless potentiality. During the Great Abandonment, when the gods left the First World, many yakshas rejected this exodus, instead staying to perform their duties as caretakers. Despite the realm's sudden dearth of divine power, the remaining yakshas swore primordial vows, allowing them to channel power from the nearby Creation's Forge into primal magic and transform swathes of the metamorphic First World into stable regions to provide refuge for destitute fey.</p>\n<p>Yakshas faced great hostility in the First World; their sheltering of impoverished fey didn't garner sympathy but instead drew scorn from others. Affronted fey aristocrats saw yaksha sanctuaries as a challenge to their authority, and the stolid plainness of yaksha domains offended the fey's aesthetic sensitivities. Thus, yaksha communities increasingly became targets and, at some uncertain time, were banished to the Universe. Some of these exiles came to settle in obscurity amid Tian Xia's forests, a fact that planar scholars record as a tragedy. After all, if these yakshas had left alongside the gods earlier, they would surely enjoy greater prominence and privilege on Golarion.</p>\n<p>Yet most yakshas spurn such sentiments, instead expressing quiet pride in fulfilling their vows where even the gods failed. Yakshas view their departure not as a dereliction, but an execution of duty. Their histories claim this egress paved the way for other persecuted fey to escape, and thus their relocation aligned with their obligations. Many yakshas still enjoy amicable relations with fey emigrants, protecting them and their descendants from First World pursuers. Just as many wander bucolic back roads and shadowy swamps, guiding lost travelers, repairing flood-torn bridges, or simply nurturing the green, growing earth—a fundamental pillar of the land. Such stalwart custodianship has earned the reclusive yakshas a reputation for being hospitable, if enigmatic, guardians of the wild.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who's a guardian spirit and has complex relationships with gods and fiends alike, swears primordial vows to uphold noble duties, and acts on behalf of the humble and forgotten, you should play a yaksha.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have sworn vows to safeguard little-known rural communities or remote wildernesses.</li>\n<li>Be stoic yet not unfeeling, accepting others' burdens to make sense of your own identity.</li>\n<li>Inordinately enjoy puns and wordplay, being so familiar with carefully worded vows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain amusement from trying to trick you into agreeing to promises to do chores or petty favors.</li>\n<li>Assume you to be tireless and self-sacrificing and expect you to never complain about responsibilities.</li>\n<li>Disdain you as simpleminded and unsophisticated and assume you have little interest in etiquette or fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Yakshas aren't born flesh-and-blood into the world. Instead, these guardian spirits occasionally manifest when two conditions are met: a surfeit of positive emotions must exist within an untamed area, and a great need for protection must arise within this land. When both conditions are met, yakshas might appear to answer common folk's prayers and protect the beleaguered land.</p>\n<p>Yakshas often appear as humans with strikingly distinctive physiques; while some stand around 7 feet with powerfully muscled statures, others boast robust portliness and stand no more than 4 feet. All possess luxurious, banyan-like manes of hair that they bind in topknots or under headscarves. The primal power of yaksha vows can sustain them for a thousand years. Ironically, due to perilous nature of their vows, few yakshas live more than a century.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most yakshas eschew pomp and disregard civilization's excesses. Instead, they gather in provincial sects or assimilate among borderland peoples. While some of the First World's yakshas reigned from kingly temple-cities, Tian Xia's yakshas discourage such grandiosity. Contemporary yakshas attribute love of lucre and prestige as temptations that led some of their number to join the Great Abandonment. Gathering in large numbers also attracted the wrath of the cruel. When the First World's yakshas sheltered weaker fey within their temple-cities, offended fey gentry launched war after war upon them. Thus, most yakshas keep to the margins of society today and do what they can to help the world around them. Where the poor and humble can be found, yakshas might also dwell to serve as protectors or avengers, enshrined in the lowborn's forlorn hopes and desperate wishes.</p>\n<p>Yakshas choose names reflecting their nearby communities' cultural influences. They often pick personal epithets as they swear their primordial vows, representing qualities or natural phenomena they aspire to embody. For example, a pacifistic warrior of the Valashmai Jungle might pick Ahimsaka, a name denoting nonviolence; a Minkaian sorcerer might name themself Osugi after a splendid tree. Names inspired by traditional idioms are also popular; yakshas often truncate such formulaic expressions to create terse, allegorically dense names.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ahimsaka, Fanren Meng, Hariti, Iryoku, Janavasbha, KyojuYasha, Mahavana, Osugi, Pattana, Tataka, Wu Shizhi</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>As guardian spirits, many yakshas are drawn toward benevolence. Their existence advocates adhering to vows and emphasizes empathy and service, which nurtures compassion. Few, though, are both kind and disciplined; witnessing divine desertion and imperial injustice has caused yakshas to doubt the efficacy and fairness of a hierarchal society, and such skepticism makes it hard for them to feel impartial about such communities. It isn't unheard of for yakshas to act recklessly and without consideration for their vows. Wildhaired, ferocious yakshas have been known to devour entire taboo-violating villages, and Iroran stories mention forest monastics taming such marauding yakshas to lead them upon the path of repentance and enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The popularity of Iroran teachings among otherwise religion-averse yakshas gives these stories credence. Irori's lessons of self-mastery sit easily alongside yaksha discipline, and Irori's mortal origins helps temper yakshas' typical disdain for divinity. Yamatsumi's worship is also not uncommon, though yaksha adherents often couch prayers as respectful requests to a more powerful sibling rather than supplications to a superior. While yakshas stridently oppose Lady Nanbyo's calamitous doctrines, they reserve their greatest antipathy for other god-spurning beings, and they relentlessly battle the cults of rakshasa immortals and asura ranas.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>guide the lost and weary, provide refuge to the weak and downtrodden, swear primordial vows</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>break a vow, gorge yourself on the extravagance of civilization</p>\n<h2>Yaksha Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaws</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Fey, Yaksha, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Swearing such a vow completes a yaksha's translation from the First World to the Universe. As an individual yaksha binds themself to guardianship, the vow renders permanent physical and spiritual transformations that manifest as yaksha heritages.</p>\n<p>All yaksha heritages come with one or more additional edicts or anathema.

        "Yaoguai": {
          "name": "Yaoguai",
          "text": "<p>Yaoguai usually begin as simple animals, plants, or objects before finding a way to awaken to sapience, becoming strange shapeshifting creatures in the process. Often originating from an infusion of ambient energy into their original form, yaoguai attain their powers through training their innate magic. Taking care not to expose their true appearance and nature, yaoguai of the same origins or species sometimes form enclaves in which they dedicate their lives to honing their powers or engaging in hedonistic pursuits—though the two aren't mutually exclusive. Yaoguai who lack a solid community, meanwhile, feel compelled to cultivate themselves until they transcend their origin, which might allow them to join society and experience a new kind of freedom.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, extraplanar beings or humanoids are transformed into yaoguai by rituals, arcane mishaps, or sheer coincidence. For some, this occurrence was their heart's desire, though others see their transformation as divine punishment for a misdeed they committed. For those wishing to change back, a long journey of atonement or discovery lies ahead, while those who accept their new forms seek ways to solidify their control over these innate gifts and amass power.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who seeks to change themself fundamentally through power, experience, or transcendence, you should play a yaoguai.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep an ear out for ways to attain, unlock, or train your power such that you can transcend your being.</li>\n<li>Distrust the intentions of others if they're capable of harming you, especially other yaoguai.</li>\n<li>Be insulted when your abilities are questioned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Show interest or awe at the powers you wield or have at your disposal.</li>\n<li>Are shocked and dismayed to learn that your true shape isn't the form you appear to be.</li>\n<li>Assume you're malicious by nature and envious of society in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>A yaoguai's original form can be virtually anything. It's faster to conclude that if something exists, so long as it basks in the perfect conditions for enough time—usually on the scale of thousands of years—it might just become a yaoguai. Yaoguai inherit a wide range of features based on their pre-awakened form; a yaoguai born of animals might have fur or pointed ears; one derived from an object might have stone- or metal-like skin. Due to their wild appearances, many adventuring yaoguai travel by night, which invites suspicion. Thus, shapeshifting into a humanoid form is one of the many arts yaoguai practice meticulously, even if all they can achieve is a form that retains many of their yaoguai features. Some yaoguai prefer such a form. Perhaps they're confident that they have nothing to hide or they like the ease of access to their yaoguai powers in this incomplete form. Others aim to perfect their humanoid form until they become indistinguishable from any other humanoid creature. Many yaoguai are born adults, though their humanoid forms can be of any apparent age. The average life span of yaoguai, in general, is often a reflection of their power. The most powerful yaoguai can easily challenge the life span of dragons, living up to several thousand years, if not becoming agelessly immortal. Rumors abound, therefore, that yaoguai might have ruled much of Tian Xia once upon a time.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Roughly three types of yaoguai exist: those who stick with other yaoguai, those who hop in and out of non-yaoguai societies, and those who live among other societies in disguise. Yaoguai who keep to themselves might be solitary with a small number of associates who live a good distance away. Yaoguai of similar origins might share a domicile and consider themselves part of a found family, with the most senior member acting as the parental or older sibling figure. Some groups have more of a master-student or ruler-retainer dynamic, particularly if the leading yaoguai is significantly more powerful.</p>\n<p>Yaoguai who dip in and out of other cultures are often tricksters who prank the communities they frequent. As bothersome and malicious activity draws attention, most yaoguai groups wisely keep their pranks helpful or tasteful to ensure their longevity. The pranks in such cases might consist of completing tasks or punching up at a local despot. Unfortunately, there are always powerful entities willing to sponsor yaoguai with evil intent, which such yaoguai take as permission to rob and attack settlements without abandon. These infamous stories are the reason why yaoguai bounty hunting is a booming industry in Tian Xia and why yaoguai who live in non-yaoguai communities go to extreme lengths to keep a low profile. Often, these yaoguai live by themselves, in pairs, or in trios at most, as they fear numbers might betray their safety.</p>\n<p>Yaoguai who spontaneously come to be typically pick their own name, which might cheekily refer to their natural form. Other yaoguai gain a name by what others call them, often a nickname that stems from a specific ability, physical trait, or a particular event or action that made them known. These naming schemes can feel like a trap for many yaoguai, however, as it accentuates their yaoguai nature rather than their experience or personality. Being bestowed a name that is unrelated to being yaoguai, or is uniquely theirs, identifies them as an individual and is a considerable honor for many, even more than titles or wealth. For some, restoring a lost or disgraced name is the desired equivalent.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>\"Lamplight\" Deng (lamp), Geomi (spider), Mindeulle (dandelion), Qing Yeliu (green snake), Qiu Haitang (pogonia), Sekiko (stone)</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>There's the misconception that yaoguai are wicked by nature, no matter their intent or actions. This is far from the truth, especially with regard to yaoguai who live among humanoid communities or seek to transcend their being. Most yaoguai can be as heroic as any other of Tian Xia's wandering adventurers. If a yaoguai came from an established yaoguai community, they might lean toward pragmatism, though there are also a few reckless tricksters. Yaoguai who spent much of their formative years by themselves or with a very small group of compatriots are often impulsive unless they follow a cultivation school or philosophy that demands otherwise. Some yaoguai are particularly susceptible to the influence of their environment and peers, meaning they change their opinions more easily and rapidly than other ancestries.</p>\n<p>Various yaoguai enclaves revere Shizuru and Tsukiyo, as it's believed that the power of sunlight and moonlight grants most yaoguai their awakening. Qi Zhong is often cited and worshipped as the guiding teacher of the first yaoguai who ascended to divinity, Sun Wukong. Though Sun Wukong ascended through dubiously ethical methods, nearly all yaoguai know of his tales and exploits, even if the Monkey King isn't a particularly popular subject of worship.</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></p>\n<p>discover your name, leave a good impression wherever you go, seek ways to cultivate your power and transcend your nature</p>\n<p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></p>\n<p>accept the limitations placed upon you, defy the laws of your enclave, dismiss an opportunity for growth</p>\n<h2>Yaoguai Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Rarity</strong> Rare</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Constitution, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Intelligence</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive). Choose from Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Fey, Kitsune, Naga, Sakvroth, Tengu, Ysoki, and any other languages to which you have access (such as the languages prevalent in your region).</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong> Humanoid, Yaoguai</p>\n<p><strong>Change Shape</strong> (concentrate, occult, polymorph, yaoguai) You transform to or from your true yaoguai form into a humanoid alternate form, which is a common Medium humanoid ancestry prevalent where you were born (typically human). This form is the same apparent age and body type as your yaoguai form and has roughly analogous physical traits, such as hair color. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. You can remain in your humanoid form indefinitely, but you revert to your yaoguai form after 1 hour of unconsciousness or 1 minute after death.</p>\n<h2>Yaoguai Heritages</h2>\n<p>Yaoguai literally come in all shapes. The entity you were before awakening as a yaoguai determines your origin. Choose one of the following yaoguai heritages at 1st level. You gain the benefits for a form only while in that form.</p>\n<p>If you're a yaoguai with a versatile heritage, you still select a yaoguai heritage to inform your character's story, but you don't gain any of its mechanical effects. You can take the Awakened Yaoguai Heritage feat to gain these effects and qualify for feats that require a specific heritage.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.buGlGWcCrdNxfCr4]{Born of Animal}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Iaq8C3bbC9EzZhBJ]{Born of Celestial}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.RXn2y7QVHVB0XHr8]{Born of Elements}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.kHvlHDq5hs2JDG0Y]{Born of Item}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.y87jU1yU8Plz4Yhq]{Born of Vegetation}</p>"

Other individuals are born under far stranger circumstances, such as having a parent who was affected by monstrous, undead, or extraplanar energies. As these circumstances aren't unique to a single ancestry, these heritages—called versatile heritages—are likewise shared by many ancestries.</p>\n<p>The peoples of Golarion are many, and they have a long history of intermingling or dabbling with forces capable of altering the very fabric of a mortal body or soul. The children born to such parents might have traits from each of their parents or physiological manifestations of the forces their ancestors were influenced by, manifesting as a specific heritage.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Heritages</h2>\n<p>Golarion is home to a variety of versatile heritages. Some are born to unusual creatures or arise through specific mundane or supernatural circumstances. Many, however, result from an infusion of extraplanar energy, whether through direct parentage, more distant ancestors, or simply direct exposure to the quintessence of that plane. These individuals are known as planar scions.</p>\n<p>Because the circumstances that give rise to versatile heritages aren't limited to a single ancestry, a versatile heritage can be chosen by a character of nearly any ancestry. Some versatile heritages are more common among some ancestries than others, and some might list additional restrictions specific to that heritage. Your GM may place other restrictions on which ancestries can use a given versatile heritage based on the story and setting. Unlimited Possibilities!</p>\n<p>Though a character can have only one heritage and one lineage feat, the possible permutations of a character's background and family tree are virtually unlimited. An aiuvarin character might still have a changeling parent whose nature is visible in the coloration of their eyes even if they don't have access to changeling ancestry feats, and a pitborn dwarf might very well have an ancestor with fey influences on their bloodline, reflected with a fey muse or patron gained through their class alongside their ancestral fiendishness.</p>\n<h2>Playing A Versatile Heritage</h2>\n<p>To play a character with a versatile heritage, first select your ancestry, just like you would for any character. You gain Hit Points, size, Speed, attribute boosts and attribute flaws, languages, traits, and other abilities from that ancestry. Then, instead of choosing a heritage from those normally available to that ancestry, apply your chosen versatile heritage. You gain all the features from your versatile heritage, some of which might modify or replace statistics, abilities, or traits from your ancestry.</p>\n<p>Since a versatile heritage is a heritage, you can have only one, and you can't have any other heritage in addition to your versatile heritage. Sometimes a versatile heritage might give you an ability that conflicts with an ability from your ancestry. In these cases, you choose which of the conflicting abilities your character has.</p>\n<p>When selecting ancestry feats, you can choose from those available to your ancestry as well as those specific to your versatile heritage.</p>\n<h2>Lineage Feats</h2>\n<p>Some ancestry feats within a versatile heritage have the lineage trait. These feats specify a physiological lineage your character has—such as the type of hag that birthed a changeling character, or the type of extraplanar entity that influenced a nephilim's birth. You can have only one lineage feat; you can select such a feat only at 1st level, and you can't retrain into or out of this feat.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Heritages</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.jAX7yavR4lNKwDK8]{Ardande}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.GAn2cdhBE9Bqa85s]{Beastkin}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.EKY9v7SF1hVsUdbH]{Changeling}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.UaD5VDoFlILEmbyz]{Dhampir}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.cbbXIV4QBred4lM5]{Dragonblood}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.ZZKZkeSP5TuT62IA]{Duskwalker}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.9FlpW1nSczH8f85v]{Hungerseed}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Svk2CHwvurK1QQhD]{Naari}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.1oLMOmLpurfWTTff]{Nephilim}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.ITgkqfnAOJCbcIys]{Oread}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.gKLTlzAVapXTQ86V]{Reflection}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.RKz7Z5pefXKiv9JE]{Suli}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.G8jfMayPv4vZvAVr]{Sylph}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Ga7UEU186pjq7LBD]{Talos}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.heritages.Item.Gmk7oNITvMVBy78Z]{Undine}</p>\n<h2>Mixed Ancestry Heritages</h2>\n<p>Golarion has numerous metropolises where people from a wide variety of ancestries intermingle.

Or in a pinch, with trebuchets, siege towers, catapults, hwachas, and all other lethal miscellanea of a combat engineers' corp. As a true artillerist, you leave the penny-ante pistols and knives to those who only need to operate on a small scale.

You're part of a team, accustomed to coordinating with your unit to maximize your time and effectiveness. Whether jumping in to help your crew load the next round, quickly calculating the trajectory of the engine's next shot, or taking the shot yourself, your presence on the team ensures their chances of success are maximized, creating a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>Leading with a Cannon</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>A proper artillerist is more than an engineer, though their skills in that field certainly shouldn't be underestimated. When a war becomes unavoidable, the presence of knights and pikemen might decide a skirmish or battle, but a well-trained artillerist with a reliable squad and a few good siege weapons can make the difference between prolonged months of battle with countless lives lost and a shorter, less bloody affair with fewer deaths and a more lasting victory.</p>\n<p>Castles and fortifications are critical tools for holding land in a world full of empires, kingdoms, and duchies all vying for power. Many wars are won or lost not based on the military might of either side, but on a castle's ability to withstand an extended siege. Without a team of engineers capable of penetrating a castle or keep's defenses, the occupants can wait out an invading force for as long as they have enough food and water to keep their citizens and defenders healthy and fed. Many wars have been \"won\" when the besieged force manages to last through a single winter. Besieging armies whose supply lines break down due to snow-clogged passes or insufficient cold weather gear are forced to retreat due to losses from poor hygiene or hypothermia long before attrition has had an opportunity to impact their opponents.</p>\n<p>An artillerist changes this dynamic, completely rewriting the rules of war. Rather than time being on the side of the besieged, it becomes the tool of the besieger. Each day that passes while a skilled artillerist hammers the castle walls with cannon fire and catapult stones brings the fortifications ever closer to crumbling down. Some wise nobles and warlords who realize their opponents have brought siege weapons, especially powerful black powder siege weapons like cannons, will choose to negotiate surrender before battle is even started, recognizing an inevitable defeat that can be staved off temporarily by sacrificing many soldiers but not thwarted without outside intervention.</p>\n<p>Ruthless or evil artillerists, or the warlords they follow, might take things a step further, specifically targeting granaries to starve enemies out or launching rotting food, corpses, or diseased livestock into parts of the town near water sources. As food and water supplies dwindle, so too does the morale of the castle's inhabitants and defenders. Even a stubborn noble or warlord will find it hard to continue resisting a siege when their own troops mutiny and their citizens begin seeking a way out.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.txWKzKuJus7UBebX]{Artillerist Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in martial weapons</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Artillery is a team sport, where every member of the crew has to rely on the other members.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The art of creating the weapons most commonly referred to as \"beast guns\" is truly ancient, with the first iterations of the weapons created on the continent of Arcadia well over 10,000 years ago. This means that beast guns predate all other forms of firearm crafting in Arcadia, even the legendary star guns, whose secrets have been lost to the ages. The tradition of designing beast guns has persisted throughout Arcadia well into the modern era, though it has become increasingly rare as the proliferation of classic firearms and the prestige associated with star guns has allowed more people access to equivalent destructive power without the intense requirements behind crafting a beast gun. However, beast gunners remain virtually unknown outside of Arcadia.</p>\n<p>The art of bonding to a beast gun and gaining the full magic of a beast gunner is an extended ritual with multiple steps, beginning with the hunt. A person seeking to bond to a beast gun typically does so with a brand new weapon made after they hunt down the creature themselves. This involves telling the story of the hunt, the beast, and the weapon created from the hunted creature. Finally, the weapon is carefully modified and tailored to ensure a proper bond between the beast gun and the prospective beast gunner. However, it's also possible to bond to an heirloom beast gun passed down through the generations by adding symbolic fresh components from the same kind of creature, after performing the same ritual hunt necessary to forge a new weapon with the intent of establishing a bond.</p>\n<p>To perform the ritual the prospective beast gunner must first plan a hunt to slay the creature corresponding to the beast gun, whether they wish to bond with a brand new beast gun or establish a link to an old beast gun. Typically, these ritualized hunts can include up to five assistants plus hunting beasts like canines or birds who help corner the beast and bring it down. If the assistants are significantly more powerful than the hunted creature, or if there are so many assistants the creature never stood a chance at survival, the magic simply fails during the bonding process and the hunt and organic materials are wasted, usually much to the shame and chagrin of the hunter. The same doesn't apply if the prospective beast gunner hunts the creature alone, even if they are significantly more powerful than the creature, such that the creature never stood a chance against them in a one on one fight.</p>\n<p>You're one of those who successfully completed the hunt and bonded with your prized weapon. Now, you seek to discover the hidden depths that others who think they know how to use beast guns can only imagine.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>Choosing your Beast Gun</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A beast gunner's bond with their beast gun is deep and mystical, so if you hope to be a successful beast gunner, it's important to choose a beast gun that suits your temperament, magic, and combat style. For example, if you favor strength and intimidation, a screech shooter is the right choice for you, whereas a spider gun might be optimal if you prefer a more careful style of setting up the battlefield in advance. Similarly, a tentacle cannon is slow and methodical and can hold an enemy in place at close range, while a drake rifle is energetic and mobile and can be used to attack from a great distance. Each beast gun has a personality and magical abilities that attract people who value them. For this reason, some experienced beast gunners say the weapon chooses you.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>8th </strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.SE38R6zpv2XelzZk]{Call Gun}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.L1gD3VMD5X9JNJzE]{Beast Gunner Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">magical</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert with at least one type of firearm, trained in Arcana or Crafting, you own a beast gun and have slain the type of creature associated with your beast gun in a fair hunt</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've unlocked the first hints of your weapon's hidden potential.

Perhaps this comes from a touch of fey or draconic blood in your family's distant past, or perhaps it's the work of some special boon or curse placed upon you.</p>\n<p>Captivators come from all areas of the world and all walks of life. A farmhand with the right gifts, sent to the market every week to hawk their latest crop, could find themself on the path to becoming a captivator. An urchin who relies on the sympathy of others just to survive may become a captivator out of necessity, and a noble, immersed in a deadly game of luxury and influence, might have trained to be a captivator since birth. Regardless of background, most captivators use their abilities to advance their station in life, make things easier for themselves, or befriend those who can help them achieve their goals.</p>\n<p>Good captivators use their gifts and skills to bring people together. They might turn a would-be tavern brawl into a night of sharing drinks and telling stories. They might offer encouragement to those facing depression or doubt. They excel at ending conflict peacefully and efficiently, leaving everyone around them happier. When faced with violence, they use their magic to quickly subdue or enthrall enemies while minimizing harm to their companions.</p>\n<p>Evil captivators manipulate others to achieve status, wealth, and power. They have no qualms about deceiving someone or using their magic to cause harm.

You and your mount are an unparalleled team, moving with shared intent to become a powerful force in combat. You might wield a banner in the name of an order of which you're a member, a liege to whom you've sworn your service, or an ideal you uphold. Or you might fight solely to further enrich your own prestige, reputation, and coffers. Traditionally, cavaliers are envisioned riding atop majestic or fearsome horses, but in reality, all kinds of animals can serve this honorable role, from riding dogs to dinosaurs.

A cavalier pledged to an order or ideal must uphold its edicts and is beholden to any anathema it has; for example, a cavalier pledged to the druid's animal order would be tied to that anathema, while a cavalier pledged to the church of Abadar would be held to the same standards as a cleric of that god. If you pledge yourself to an entity or cause without a stated anathema, you should work with your GM to determine the edicts and anathema associated with your pledge. Cavaliers who have pledged themselves can gain access to certain abilities related to that pledge, such as Cavalier's Banner. If you violate the anathema of your pledge, you lose access to those feats until you benefit from an <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone}</em> ritual.

The awe-inspiring presence of these creatures makes them worthy of reverence-or even outright worship. Dragon disciples dedicate themselves to becoming like these great beasts, with each disciple striving to typify one variety of dragon. Sorcerers of draconic blood, barbarians with the dragon instinct, and many kobolds with close ties to their draconic predecessors become dragon disciples, but anyone who has encountered one of these terrifying creatures might follow this path.</p>\n<p>As a dragon disciple, you study and learn from the example of dragons, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you admire the dragons you emulate. While most dragon disciples do indeed revere their chosen dragon, countless tales are told of dragon disciples born of great personal tragedy at the hands of boundless draconic fury. These disciples have transformed themselves into what they despise in order to gain the power to destroy their draconic tormentor and at long last earn their revenge.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>Instinct of the Wyrm</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The acquisition of draconic might can change the dragon disciple's body and give them magical abilities, as reflected in the archetype's feats, but the mind often changes as well, potentially even overwhelming the disciple's normal personality. Any dragon disciple can find the attitudes of dragonkind intruding into their thoughts. The foremost emotion among all types of dragons is pride. Even the influence of a benevolent metallic dragon can overwhelm a dragon disciple with pride. When tempered, this feeling levels out to a steady confidence, but when uncontrolled, it can grow to an air of arrogance or superiority.</p>\n<p>Disciples of metallic dragons also feel the pangs of compassion and benevolence. They grow to be more focused on cooperation and might take on leadership roles. Disciples of the vile chromatic dragons are plagued by thoughts of cruelty and greed. They long to see fear in the eyes of foe and friend alike. Those who succumb to these thoughts become bullies or tyrants.</p>\n<p>Instinctual draconic feelings can be constant, yet they seem to intensify when the disciple uses their draconic powers. In the few seconds after using a breath weapon or attacking with claws, or when the disciple sprouts wings, they might have a moment of mental transformation. This can bring on the full mindset of a dragon, or even make the disciple temporarily believe they truly are a dragon, and is often accompanied by a draconic roar, cackle, or majestic display.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.oo34CloLefFRi72w]{Dragon Disciple Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n<li>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Access</strong> You are a kobold with the dragonscaled or spellscaled heritage, a dragon instinct barbarian, or a draconic bloodline sorcerer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You choose to study or worship one type of dragon, and your focus grants you a measure of its power.

These spirits might choose a form that strikes their fancy or inhabit one that best reflects their personality, temperament, or philosophy. Sometimes, an apparition achieves a greater awareness that results in a spiritual awakening. Such entities might develop a strong magical connection to the world that elevates and separates them from others of their kind. Over time, they might form connections or mystical bonds with worthy individuals to serve throughout their chosen partner's lifetime, possibly continuing on to watch over their partner's descendants and becoming spiritual household guardians. Typically, these apparitions are remnants of humanoid souls or personifications of spiritually infused items or locations, but in some cases, primal spirits form similar bonds, granting a greater connection to the five elements and the natural world. Regardless of the fundamental nature of these spirits, those who have mastered the ability to conjure and control a familiar can form a bond with them that unlocks a unique and potent well of shared magical energy.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.YKBDNQEqYPKE8dlH]{Familiar Sage Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You have a familiar, you're able to cast spells</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've forged an empowered mystical bond with your familiar.

Your soul carries on, but your body is gone. Your mind, too, may have changed: though death can impact thoughts and desires in all sorts of ways, most ghosts experience stronger, more volatile emotions and are frequently overcome by their past ties.

You gain the ghost, spirit, and undead traits, and the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.ancestryfeatures.Item.SAbzItAI4uwbdnQk]{Basic Undead Benefits}. Your undead craving is to settle your unfinished business. You also gain the incorporeal trait, except you can't pass through solid objects unless you select the Pass Through feat. Being a ghost has the following major effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Floating</strong> You can float but are still tethered to the ground. Replace your land Speed with an equal fly Speed. You can't rise more than a few inches above the ground when you Fly. This means you can move above many types of difficult or hazardous terrain without moving slowly or being damaged, even though you can't fly without limit. You can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump}, and take similar actions, and use your fly Speed for any calculations that would normally require your land Speed.</p>\n<p><strong>Items</strong> You can transmute physical items to make them part of your incorporeal form. This requires spending 10 minutes with the items within reach, during which you transform the items into part of your form; you can return items you already have incorporated to a corporeal state at the same time. The items retain all their runes and other abilities, need to be invested normally if they have the invested trait, and need to be worn, held, or stowed appropriately. Once you've incorporated the items, you and other incorporeal creatures can use them normally-you can Interact with them, Release them, and so on. Your incorporated weapons gain the benefits of the ghost touch property rune, allowing you to use them normally against both corporeal and incorporeal creatures. Incorporated items become corporeal again only if you transmute them back or are destroyed, in which case, they drop to the ground under you.</p>\n<p><strong>Attacks</strong> Your unarmed attacks become magical and deal void damage instead of their normal type.</p>\n<p><strong>Strength</strong> Unlike most incorporeal creatures, your Strength modifier is not -5; you keep the same Strength score you had before you became a ghost, though you can only attempt Strength-based skill checks-typically Athletics checks-against other incorporeal creatures, as normal for an incorporeal creature. Against incorporeal creatures, use your Strength normally to determine the results of Athletics checks, Strikes with melee weapons, and any other checks or damage rolls dependent on Strength.</p>\n<p><strong>Ties that Bind</strong> When you become a ghost, work with your GM to choose a bound site and unfinished business, both of which matter for your character's story, as well as some ghost archetype feats. Your bound site tethers you to the physical world and is typically either a location important to you in life or the place where you died. Unfinished business keeps you from passing to the afterlife. If someone resolves your unfinished business, you decide whether to accept the change and pass on, or to fight it. If you pass on, you get a few minutes to say your goodbyes, and then move into the River of Souls and the afterlife. Your character ceases to be. If you fight the change, you remain, though you and the GM might determine a new unfinished business. If you are physically destroyed, you cease your existence as a ghost but still might not be able to pass on to the afterlife if your unfinished business is incomplete. In this liminal state, you might come across strange energies and become another sort of creature, or anchor to a summoner and become an eidolon.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xUaEpnfd1FMGNG1z]{Frightful Moan} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">auditory</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">divine</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">emotion</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">fear</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mental</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xUaEpnfd1FMGNG1z inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pwM4RGwCTLiVSic0]{Ghostly Resistance} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pwM4RGwCTLiVSic0 inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ozm0xy2lrOq6GiWU]{Ghostly Grasp} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Ozm0xy2lrOq6GiWU inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.zJXsGF61lH0WHw5v]{Ghost Flight} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.zJXsGF61lH0WHw5v inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fyWKASX6uNByJF5]{Pass Through} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fyWKASX6uNByJF5 inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AtidbY3lU49taaUR]{Rejuvenation} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AtidbY3lU49taaUR inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LhqWrgeBH2sdRxND]{Unlimited Ghost Flight} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LhqWrgeBH2sdRxND inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Book of the Dead</em></span></p>"

The moment you become a ghoul, your existence focuses upon satisfying this endless craving. Ghouls who go more than a few days without feeding on freshly dead humanoid flesh find themselves in constant pain; those who go for more than a week might be driven to the edge of delirium, becoming bestial in their craving.</p>\n<p>When you succumb to ghoul fever and become a ghoul, you don't lose your mind or memories. You keep your personality only to have it warped by the never-ending need to consume flesh. A brave warrior remains brave, but under the curse of the fever, that brave warrior's prime directive is to consume flesh. A rogue might go from finding clever ways to pick pockets to finding ways to waylay opponents and devour them.</p>\n<p>Since most societies don't allow cannibalism, ghouls who wish to continue their old lives must satisfy their cravings in secret, finding a way to balance society's rules while feeding the constant gnawing hunger inside them. Some take up professions that allow them to secretly eat dead flesh or create dead bodies to feed upon. There are tales told of ghoul mercenary troops who satisfy their cravings and profit, while ghoul spellcasters can use their magic to procure and preserve flesh.</p>\n<p>Ghouls who won't restrain themselves with rules of the living may join or establish ghoul societies.

Though the Magaambya seeks to hold true to Jatembe's teachings by aiming to understand magic of all kinds, the mages of the Magaambya have found the most success with magic rooted in the material world. Halcyon speakers are powerful conversants who epitomize the Magaambyan practice of blending arcane and primal magic, seeing both traditions as flowing from the same wellspring.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Halcyon Spells</h2>\n<p>Through hard study, Magaambyans can meld arcane and primal spellcasting. Halcyon spells are spells from the arcane or primal spell list. You don't gain new halcyon spells via the normal means you typically use to gain spells; instead, you gain new halcyon spells and new spell ranks of halcyon spells only through feats. Halcyon spells are prepared or cast just like other spells granted by your class; for example, a wizard who gained halcyon spells would add them to their spell list and their spellbook, while a sorcerer would add them to their spell list and their spell repertoire. If you have more than one arcane or primal spellcasting class, you add halcyon spells to all such classes.</p>\n<p>Each time you cast a halcyon spell, decide whether it is an arcane or primal spell. You can't heighten a halcyon spell beyond your maximum spell rank of halcyon spell, even if you have higher-rank spell slots, and you can't select a halcyon spell as a signature spell.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, and each time you gain a halcyon feat, you can swap out one of your old halcyon spells for a different halcyon spell of the same rank; this is in addition to any swapping from your class, such as via a sorcerer's spell repertoire class feature. You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.7fU6e3HIT4NvwLYa]{Halcyon Speaker Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Magaambyan Attendant Dedication, member of the Magaambya of conversant rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You devote much of your study to halcyon magic.

Many tap into these powers with no consideration of the morality of their use. For these unscrupulous magic users, it's simply another avenue in their never-ending pursuit of power, and the abilities learned are turned to the caster's personal ends, whatever they may be.</p>\n<p>Others choose a different path. Through spiritual study and introspection, they have come to recognize the evil intrinsic in the existence of undead, the fundamental wrongness of using the universal energy of death to create an appearance of life. To combat this evil, these casters learn to conduct vitality energy and direct it to great effect against the undead they encounter. They may also engage in ongoing study to learn of the nature of life, death, and undeath, and the precise relationship between each state. These scholars and mages are commonly known as hallowed necromancers-a slightly misrepresentative name, as many of them don't use religious methods, but a frequently used shorthand regardless.</p>\n<p>The exact origin of hallowed necromancers' abilities may vary from one to the next. Some are granted their gifts directly by a sympathetic deity such as Sarenrae or Pharasma, while others might use their knowledge of religion and the planes to learn such abilities on their own. Though rarer, it's even possible these practitioners might discover they possess an intuitive understanding and control over abilities that manifest spontaneously as their capabilities grow. Despite this variance, all share a fundamental understanding that undeath is an aberration to be quickly remedied.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of hallowed necromancers have similar goals and are willing to work together, they tend not to form their own organizations. More often, these necromancers attach themselves to existing groups-such as the Knights of Lastwall or Voices of the Spire-and use their powers in support of those groups' causes. Otherwise, they plan and carry out their own personal vendettas against the forces of undeath, often enlisting the help of trusted friends and allies.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>Hallowed Necromancy in Geb</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>As hallowed necromancy lacks any unified credo, its practitioners are found throughout Golarion. It's rare they make their presence known within the borders of Geb, however. Those who hide their profession usually move on to other lands and those who openly crusade against Geb's many undead quickly find themselves utterly overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Hallowed necromancers captured in Geb might be executed only to be risen by their foes with their spellcasting ability intact but moral code absent or twisted.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.63L2iSAxkHyq6qEt]{Hallowed Necromancer Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> good alignment, able to cast spells using spell slots, able to cast at least one necromancy spell, expert in Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You've studied techniques allowing you to blend so-called hallowed necromancy into your own spellcasting to bolster the living and destroy the undead.

Despite the trials you underwent and decades spent sequestered away with magical tomes, you know with every fiber of your being that it's all been worth it. You devised a unique and incredibly evil ritual to tear your soul from your body, and you painstakingly crafted a receptacle to house your freed soul. Immortality now lies within your grasp.</p>\n<p>Becoming a lich requires much more than just magical knowledge. It demands fierce intelligence, bold ingenuity, incredible determination, unending patience, and a strict adherence to perfection, along with incredible skill as an artisan, for each lich must create their own soul cage. A mispronounced word or flaw in the construction of your soul cage would end not in immortality but ignominious death. You have all these skills in abundance and now, with your ascension, you've proven your superiority beyond a shadow of a doubt.</p>\n<p>As a lich, you understand better than any the power and potential of magic. Many liches strive to increase their magical skills and foil the magic of any who dare oppose them. Others delve so deeply into necromantic arts and foul rituals that their flesh can burn the living, causing biological processes to falter and filling those who behold them with uncontrollable fear.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what paths they pursue, nearly all liches are obsessed with their soul cage, spending untold hours and a veritable fortune to protect it, surrounding it with magical and mundane hazards, and guarding it with powerful, loyal defenders. Some liches prefer to secure their soul cage through obscurity rather than force, enshrouding it in magical abjurations or illusions to hide it from prying eyes. The most gifted crafters among liches tinker and improve their soul cage over time, rendering it nigh indestructible. This is a dangerous proposition, undertaken by only the most confident and arrogant magical engineers, as physically altering one's soul cage could have unintended consequences on its function. Many wizard liches instead learn to tap into the soul cage's magical energy from afar to fuel their own spellcasting.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats</strong>: <strong>14th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.AXy4A7zTYk1JAiOV]{Magic Sense}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.peUBtdoG5LyVaf5g]{Lich Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> living creature, ability to cast 6th-rank or higher spells from spell slots, expert in Crafting, completed ritual to become a lich and crafted a soul cage</p>\n<hr />\n<p>After years of study and careful planning, you finally completed a soul cage to house your soul and successfully performed a ritual to transform yourself into a lich.

You can also swap out halcyon spells by retraining during downtime. If you have a spellbook, when you swap out a halcyon spell, you lose the spell from your spellbook entirely.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ZhToff996PnTESwb]{Magaambyan Attendant Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Arcana or Nature, member of the Magaambya of attendant rank</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You devote much of your study to halcyon magic.

Regardless of their preferred method of combat, marshals' ability to bring the best out in every ally is a valuable addition to any group. Though not every marshal is seen by their allies as a source of encouragement. Such marshals strike fear both in enemies and allies alike to inspire competence in battle and ensure that cowardice will not be tolerated.

Your training is focused and practical, and since you have turned every part of your body into a weapon, you never find yourself without one. While you might have learned your techniques in a dojo or school focused on training the body, you might just as easily have learned them in street brawls and bar fights, combining instincts with intense athleticism for a deadly combination.</p>\n<p>Regardless of your origins, your path is one of iron, transforming your body into a deadly weapon. The techniques available are many, but the results are all the same. Whether you attack with your fist, fang, or foot, your prowess is undeniable. Many martial artists seek to master a stance to put form to their flurry of attacks. Such techniques allow one to channel their strength.

A keen and incisive perception is necessary, of course, but that alone won't be sufficient. While many a ranger or rogue must sharpen their senses or face a short career, a true overwatch must be able to apply information received from all five senses (and any additional special senses they might have) to make split-second decisions that work toward achieving a tactical goal. Such a response can partially be trained through hours of daily drills designed to help a potential overwatch separate true threats and situations requiring their skills from false positives, and even situations where they would cause a problem if they didn't hold back. However, while training helps ingrain good practice into one's reflexes and muscle memory, ultimately, an overwatch candidate who lacks an innate degree of good tactical instinct will find such training slow to produce results, or in the worst case, even impossible.</p>\n<p>Beyond senses and instinct, the role of overwatch requires the ability to innovate your enhanced visual gear to assist in removing blind spots and seeing what others miss. This is essential, since you must keep track of your team and nearby foes. While it isn't explicitly necessary for you to be the one with enough skill in Crafting to maintain and upgrade your enhanced visual gear, many successful overwatches choose to do so in order to better understand how every piece works together to create the whole.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.t03Tc5I4B8RHsyqs]{Overwatch Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> expert in Perception</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have an innate knack for tactical observation, and you've innovated to apply that knack in a variety of ways that allow you to assist your allies.

You might wield a single pistol, a pair of pistols, or a pistol paired with a melee weapon to pull off showy maneuvers. However you slice it, though, the use of pistols or other one-handed firearms is crucial to your technique and style.</p>\n<p>To you, everything is a show, and you use your gun as a prop and instrument, not just to kill opponents but to trick, mislead, hinder, and even bully them into doing what you want them to do. While others tend to focus on delivering as much devastation downrange as possible, your style is all about control. By controlling a foe's attention and actions, you can bolster your own attacks and mitigate the foe's potential for mayhem. You control the tempo of the battle much as you would a staged performance, carefully ensuring your foe's actions don't fall outside of your intended script. You're both the director and the star of this show, and your enemies dance to the tune you play with your pistol... sometimes quite literally!</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>What Makes a Phenom?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Many gunslingers can learn how to twirl a pistol or intimidate a foe, but it's not just your skills that make you a phenom, it's your style and attitude. As a pistol phenom, you understand how to grab everyone's attention with everything you do, especially the way you talk, the way you walk, and the way you use your gun. But what's more, you're well aware of that fact and the power you have over others, and you aren't afraid to flaunt it.</p>\n<p>Despite this attitude, or perhaps because of it, as a pistol phenom you likely tend to get along well with groups of allies, understanding both how to take the spotlight to protect your allies and how to share it to make sure they get their time in the sun. The one exception to this can be other pistol phenoms. When two or more pistol phenoms gather in the same group, it's almost inevitable for a duel or other contest to arise. However, such a contest need not end in enmity. Depending on your temperament, and that of the other pistol phenom, the result of the exhilarating rivalry expressed during competition could be a lifelong friendship, albeit one in which you both keep score of your greatest achievements to compare exploits.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PFMsj4LtdAIuGn4R]{Pistol Phenom Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in at least one type of one-handed firearm, trained in Deception, trained in Performance</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You catch an opponent @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} by spinning your weapon.

Few are more resourceful. Given time and a handful of gears, bits, and widgets, you can create the perfect tool for just about any situation. Your ingenuity is extremely valuable while adventuring. Adventurers never truly know what's in store for them and often find themselves ill-prepared for the task at hand. Bringing along a scrounger such as you is like bringing any tool that could possibly be needed, provided your constant attempts to break down and reassemble everything aren't a bother. You never know what you may need in the future.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CaeCSWFWytWv8Fgu]{Scrounger Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Crafting</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While others need specialized tools and a dedicated space, you have found a way to build just about anything, anywhere.

You stand solid on any battlefield, encased in the sturdiest armor you can find. When danger threatens, your solid defenses will safely get you, and hopefully your companions, home again. As a sentinel, you might be part of an order of knights or bodyguards who trained you how best to take advantage of heavy armor.

Some witches or sorcerers have chosen to follow the path of the sentinel to increase their survivability. While this is less common, it's not less effective. Few will argue against stronger, heavier armor leading to a longer life, and as every turtle knows, it's always nice to have a nice hard shell to fall back on when threatened. No one has a tougher shell than a sentinel. Even in the midst of great battles, you know that your armor is your greatest ally. It won't abandon you, break, or falter as things get tough.

Whether your unique abilities are the result of weeks of experimentation or a secret passed to you by a traveling practitioner, you delight in surprising others with your tricks.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>The Fruits of Research</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>While magic can spring from many sources, from wizard tutors to self-taught savants, the art of the spell trickster often springs from sophisticated magical research. The magical academies in Golarion have no claim to magic as a whole but can often teach lesser-known variants of a spell to their students. At the Magaambya academy in the Mwangi Expanse, for instance, initiates study multiple traditions of magic, adapting the techniques of harnessing magical essence from one tradition to create new methods of casting spells in another. The Arclords of Nex have spent thousands of years honing spells in both wartime and peace, demonstrating a fine control over the arcane by effortlessly changing their magic to suit their whims. The return of New Thassilon brought thousands of magical dabblers and scholars, each with their own unique tricks and each eager to see what new spell variants have developed in their long absence.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that spell tricksters come solely from high academia. A sorcerer might demonstrate aberrant powers in her bloodline magic, hinting at a background more complex than a single eldritch influence acting upon her. An oracle might grope at a divine power that they poorly understand and cast a spell in a unique manner simply because they were never taught otherwise. A witch's patron or a whimsical deity might grant a favored servant a special power for whatever strange motives such beings might possess. Magic in Golarion isn't entirely predictable, no matter how many practitioners wish that it was so. While most spellcasters follow predictable patterns in their art, there are always exceptions.</p>\n<p>The rules in this section are presented as part of an archetype, meant for a character dedicated to the art of innovating magic—but you don't have to limit yourself to this premise. At the GM's discretion, a spell trickster feat could be made available to a character as a class feat without the character taking the archetype. In most cases, this option should only be offered as a reward or story element that the character, GM, or group has dedicated a significant amount of time to developing—a character who wishes to partake in these options without GM permission or involvement should simply take the spell trickster archetype. These feats could be used to represent the payoff from extended magical research; finding forgotten or forbidden lore in a lost corner of Golarion; pleasing a god, patron, or other notable power; a magical plane or artifact exerting its influence; or any other number of situations that an adventurer might encounter while exploring. Keep in mind, however, that these feats were created and balanced to be part of an archetype. If allowing spell trickster feats as general class feats begins to negatively impact the game, the players should be willing to walk the decision back and rebuild characters as necessary.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.CbqaiI0TKsyDywDr]{Spell Trickster Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Able to cast spells, trained in Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your experience with magic and its traditions lets you specialize in the casting of certain spells, customizing familiar spells to create novel effects.

They come from a tradition of ancient secrets and principles, which they temper with modern innovation and perspective. Spellshots combine magical power into the art of gunplay to create a distinct and mystical way known only to spellshots, enigmatic and unavailable to other gunslingers. The first to identify themselves as spellshots tied their magical traditions to the history of the Star Code and the Crowned Regents in Arcadia. Ancient, reclusive crafters known as the Crowned Regents created star guns, the legendary magical firearms that shoot white-hot blasts of energy.

The sterling dynamo's adaptability grants it vast potential, so the sky's the limit!</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:right\">\n<th>Prosthetics in Golarion</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Prosthetics in Golarion don't require membership in an archetype or special organization to obtain. A character can purchase a simple prosthetic foot, eye, hand, or virtually any other body part for as little as 5 silver pieces, with more expensive prosthetics that are decorated with unique customizations or designs available for a corresponding mark-up. For more information on prosthetics, see page 69 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Grand Bazaar. The sterling dynamo prosthetic technology presented here was created through collaboration between a Dongun Hold prosthesis inventor, who created the flexible silvery clockwork joint system, and a researcher from the Clockwork Cathedral in Absalom, who created a prototype variant that increased how customizable the model was and sent it back to the dwarven inventor to iterate further. That iteration became the sterling dynamo that entered the market in late 4721 AR. It has been widely applauded for its adaptability in both combat and everyday use.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fdSbB0EQVxFgLoEd]{Sterling Dynamo Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n<li>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You obtain a sterling dynamo prosthetic, which allows you to replace or augment a limb, or even add a simple new non-prehensile limb, such as a tail. While your sterling dynamo prosthetic can replace a missing prehensile limb, such as an arm, choosing to add a new limb can never increases your character's number of hands or prehensile limbs beyond two, even in combination with other abilities or effects.</p>\n<p>Your sterling dynamo prosthesis is especially optimized for combat, granting you a dynamo melee unarmed attack that is in the brawling weapon group and is made of silver (which makes it more effective against certain types of creatures, such as devils and werewolves).</p>\n<p>You have several options to customize your sterling dynamo. First, choose whether you have a power driver dynamo, which deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage and has the shove trait, or a percussive striker dynamo, which deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage and has the agile and finesse traits.</p>\n<p>Most dynamos are automated, so they don't require a free hand to use, like other unarmed attacks. However, you can instead choose to make your dynamo be manually controlled via a handheld switch, lever, or other device; to make an attack with a manually controlled dynamo, you must have a hand free to operate it, but the benefit is great control and a more devastating strike. This increases the damage die by one size, to a 1d8 for a power drive dynamo or 1d6 for a percussive striker dynamo. Arm dynamos are always manual, but they use the hand on that arm to operate the dynamo when making strikes. Manual control is required only in the heat of combat, not for less strenuous adventuring or everyday activities.</p>\n<p>You need to keep your sterling dynamo wound, but the process isn't particularly onerous, so in most situations, it won't be an issue. If you spend 1 minute winding up your dynamo, it can remain active for 24 hours before needing additional winding. However, enemies can attempt to Disable the dynamo, which has a level equal to your own, to reduce the remaining operational time by 1 hour, or 2 hours on a critical success. Certain other abilities that adversely affect technology might also reduce the dynamo's remaining operational time. When your dynamo is out of operational time, you can still use it as a normal prosthetic, but you cannot use your dynamo unarmed attack or any other abilities from this archetype until you wind the dynamo again. You can wind the dynamo for 1 minute at any time to return it to the maximum 24 hours of operational time.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm]{Modular Dynamo} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sVEF7j9Wh1KNGPUm inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.0SbHdwYumvmzwWw3]{Piston Punch} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.0SbHdwYumvmzwWw3 inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.A0keRhzNlcB1u4gD]{Stasian Smash} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.A0keRhzNlcB1u4gD inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K0x90HNHi5hONdDl]{Beast Dynamo Howl} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K0x90HNHi5hONdDl inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xzesXSIXTqsVxm1e]{Construct Dynamo} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xzesXSIXTqsVxm1e inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fyJ2slL98hnQH3On]{Soaring Dynamo} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fyJ2slL98hnQH3On inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Guns &amp; Gears</em></span></p>"

But magic is so much more than that—it's thought, will, and action, and with the right talismans, you can make even the cut of a sword a deeply magical act. This all hinges on the small magical talismans you affix to your gear. You know how to make and use the perfect talisman for any job. The utility of talismans seems endless. They can help swords to swing harder, shields to block better, grant a burst of speed in a desperate situation, and even save one from a lethal fall. This all excites you, but no more than exploring just how far you can push your talent. What are the true limits of these baubles? You've heard rumors and tales of great dabblers like yourself mastering the art of creating and affixing fantastical magical memorabilia. Some say that these great sages have found a way to affix multiple talismans to a single object, circumventing the most fundamental limitation of the art. Whether you were formally trained or picked up the skill as a hobby, your talent is undeniable, and the usefulness of talismans is apparent. Take advantage of every ounce of magic you can manipulate and master these mystical trinkets.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.1t5479E6bdvFs4E7]{Talisman Dabbler Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You are trained in the use of talismans and similar magical paraphernalia.

Ultimately, either could be true about your character, or some combination of both. You might decide the truth together with the GM as soon as you take this archetype or hold off until later to make that call.

While some vehicle mechanic unions are secular, many realize the benefits of organizing alongside a sympathetic religion, and so they typically adopt the ideals of economically-focused gods like Abadar or deities interested in crafting such as the goddess Brigh—the Whisper in Bronze—the goddess of invention. Whether religious or secular, vehicle mechanic unions take the bonds between fellow union members seriously.

Becoming a living mummy - one capable of both motion and thought - is another thing altogether.</p>\n<p>Most of those forced into undeath as mummies are bound to tombs, temples, and vaults as guardians. Some willingly undergo the process, embracing death to live beyond it. These willing mummies become the most powerful of their kind, rising above their brethren like an emperor above their subjects.</p>\n<p>The horrifically painful living mummification process must be performed by others - usually a team of well-trained necromancers, priests, or ritualists - upon a still-living subject. Death by mummification is gruesome, but to be kept alive for as long as possible throughout the process is a thousandfold worse. The process usually takes weeks, beginning with forced starvation, followed by the consumption of spices and tonics that desiccate the subject's internal organs.</p>\n<p>Very rarely, mummies are created by natural processes occurring in locations that are cursed or inundated by void energy. These mummies most often rise in deserts, bogs, swamps, at high altitudes, or in frigid locales. Although the process through which they are created is less painful and far shorter in duration, the spiritual shift from living to undead is no less traumatizing.</p>\n<p>Mummies are most commonly found in Geb and Osirion, as well as the surrounding nations of Thuvia, Katapesh, and Qadira. They have a foothold in the Gravelands, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Mwangi Expanse, particularly around Mzali.

If you choose to stabilize your timestream, you don't roll initiative, and instead your initiative is equal to 10 + your initiative modifier. If you choose to destabilize your timestream, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11].

If a foe places a misfortune effect on your roll and the effect applies to your roll, you enter a curse maelstrom state, and if you fail a saving throw against a foe's curse effect and are affected by the curse, you also enter a curse maelstrom state. No matter the source, you can only enter a curse maelstrom state during an encounter, and if you don't end the state on your own, it ends at the end of the encounter. Once it ends, you can't enter a curse maelstrom state again for 1 minute.</p>\n<p>While in a curse maelstrom state, you can't benefit from fortune effects, and they also don't cancel misfortune effects on you; they simply have no effect. While in this state, all creatures other than you within a 10-foot emanation take a -1 status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks due to the storm of bad luck swirling out of your body. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.IV8sgoLO6ShD3DCJ]{Expel Maelstrom} action, which you can use to focus the brunt of your curses onto an unlucky target.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.5f8gQxVdioUcgsTD]{Familiar Oddities} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">skill</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.5f8gQxVdioUcgsTD inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.JZurhROfi2JfmLfb]{Unnerving Expansion} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.JZurhROfi2JfmLfb inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.adr9buwVuxgZV2B3]{Share Burden} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.adr9buwVuxgZV2B3 inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fhwO3N3VoZ0ZpfjU]{Accursed Magic} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fhwO3N3VoZ0ZpfjU inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.3xkFb2qlAdgLmdSf]{Counter Curse} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.3xkFb2qlAdgLmdSf inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.wxIOuPFjVBADNYDP]{Torrential Backlash} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.wxIOuPFjVBADNYDP inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.WyGeBz9U6Hovozdl]{Reverse Curse} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.WyGeBz9U6Hovozdl inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>"

          "text": "<p>\"The mind makes it real.\" Though uttered in many parts of Golarion, nowhere is this more literal than perhaps among mind smiths—those with a mysterious mental talent that allows them to manifest their mind into a physical object. Some gain this power through magical training from an ancestor or mentor, while others earn it as a gift or reward from some greater being, or by inexplicable chance. Whatever the source, you have mastered the ability to form a mental image into a corporeal figment solid enough to affect the physical world. You trained the power to aid you in battle by shaping itself into a potent weapon, bound by only the reaches of your own imagination.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.juikoiIA0Jy8PboY]{Mind Smith Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n<li>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You've learned to imagine a shape in your mind, to envision it so strongly it takes form in the material world. You gain a single melee weapon of your choosing, called a mind weapon. Your mind weapon is a martial melee weapon. The overall shape and design of your mind weapon can be of your choosing but it has one of the following four basic statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d4 damage and has the agile and finesse traits</li>\n<li>A one-handed weapon that deals 1d6 damage and has the finesse trait</li>\n<li>A one-handed weapon that deals d8 damage</li>\n<li>A two-handed weapon that deals 1d10 damage and has the reach trait</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each day during your daily preparations, you can decide if you want your weapon to deal bludgeoning damage and be in the club weapon group, deal piercing damage and be in the spear weapon group, or deal slashing damage and be in the sword weapon group. Your mind weapon is an extension of your mind-it has no Hardness, and any ability that would damage your mind weapon instead damages you directly, pushing back against the weapon's corporeal form and becoming mental damage of the same amount the weapon would have taken.</p>\n<p>You can project your mind weapon using an Interact action, just as you would draw any other weapon. Only you can hold, carry, or wield your mind weapon; if held by another person, it quickly disappears from their hand, reforming in your mind for you to project again. If you're disarmed of your mind weapon, it dematerializes, but you can draw it again with an Interact action starting at the beginning of your next turn.</p>\n<p>Upon creating your mind weapon, you also learn to use a mind smith's keepsake: an object of light Bulk, such as a bracelet or figurine, that you wear or keep on your person and inscribe with weapon runes. Your keepsake can't be a magic item, nor can it have any significant monetary value beyond the value of any runes you inscribe on it. You can buy and inscribe fundamental runes and weapon property runes onto your keepsake in the same way you would for a regular weapon, and you can move runes to and from your keepsake to other weapons or runestones for the usual cost. Any runes inscribed on the keepsake apply to your mind weapon when you create it. If your keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 week of downtime imprinting a new object with your weapon's mental properties, though this new keepsake won't have any of the runes that were inscribed on the prior keepsake.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.aMI39DZhWgNgJTAn]{Malleable Movement} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">skill</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.aMI39DZhWgNgJTAn inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.tor4lzY0wpNcJd2U]{Ghost Blade} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">concentrate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.tor4lzY0wpNcJd2U inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.cB6K0wkiDhduAjtL]{Just the Tool} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">concentrate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.cB6K0wkiDhduAjtL inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.yantkiDNmsT5ONZX]{Mental Forge} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 4</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.yantkiDNmsT5ONZX inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xaSlCFYUXlu5f0zw]{Mind Shards} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 6</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">concentrate</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">magical</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mental</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xaSlCFYUXlu5f0zw inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PccekOihIbRWdDky]{Malleable Mental Forge} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.PccekOihIbRWdDky inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.P5Zu46vfO4ptBBoj]{Mind Projectiles} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 8</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.P5Zu46vfO4ptBBoj inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.2uQbQgz1AbjzcFSp]{Runic Mind Smithing} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 10</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.2uQbQgz1AbjzcFSp inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8KUvJuAWCoxWg5FH]{Metallic Envisionment} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.8KUvJuAWCoxWg5FH inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fgnfXwFcn9jZlXGD]{Advanced Runic Mind Smithing} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.fgnfXwFcn9jZlXGD inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder Dark Archive</em></span></p>"

You prefer to bargain.</p>\n<p>As a pactbinder, you make deals with strange entities, otherworldly beings, and all sorts of multiversal denizens, amiable and unapproachable alike.

In fact, sometimes, those who don't understand pacts like you do might mistake the payment for the benefit, or vice versa. Perhaps an ancient being of nightmare demanded to consume something you sought to be rid of, like a painful memory or a negative personality trait, priding itself on how it was taking something personal from you. Little did it know, you let it win on haggling your end of the deal. Of course, this practice isn't without its own risks, as who knows what you might become without that part of you.</p>\n<p>All these things, you can and must consider in every pact.

Unlike other Ilverani, also called \"snowcaster elves\" by outsiders, you find outsiders interesting and believe there is much to learn from having conversations and relationships with others. Whether to watch them, teach them, or to keep would-be enemies close, you believe a broad smile, ageless learning, and a watchful eye are key. Some see this watchful and outwardly friendly nature as condescending, but they don't understand the reason why worshipers of Findeladlara feel a duty to uphold this tradition. When Earthfall struck and most of the other elves on Golarion fled to Sovyrian or delved deep into the earth, the elves that would one day come to be known as Ilverani remained and sought to shelter others from catastrophe. They built refuges to protect others and helped guide people to safety during the Age of Darkness. While Twilight Seekers today don't build safe structures, they do work to build bonds among people so that society can be protected against other catastrophic events should they come to pass.</p>\n<p>This calling brings you in contact with many different cultures, yet you seek to preserve the ways of your people. To this end, you are ever on your guard against the lure of \"modern fads.\" Unfortunately, some twilight speakers have succumbed to the allure of other ways of life and, for them, there is only one outcome: exile.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.uBr7wHtOS6KIhHnd]{Twilight Speaker Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Society, you are an Ilverani elf</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have carefully studied the histories, customs, and etiquette of many of the younger peoples of Golarion.

Such items might even be used to house additional insects if their swarm grows too big to fit inside their body.</p>\n<p>Swarmkeepers can add new capabilities to their swarms. For some, this means incorporating many different species of insects into their swarm, making even mortal enemies in nature work together. Others selectively cultivate one kind of insect precious to them into various morphs that give the swarm new capabilities.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.a3YLHiWsfAFeFVYO]{Swarmkeeper Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> trained in Nature</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Your body has become a symbiotic hive for a swarm of crawling insects.

          "text": "<p>According to folklore, the thlipit martial art began with a wager. A group of bored tripkees looking for a little sport devised a game of using their tongues to gather fruit out of nearby trees. As the competition wore on and the bets escalated, the contestants began snatching falling fruit in midair and even using their tongues to push away the competition. While the names of the original competitors vary between tellings, all agree that the contest ended with a particularly magnificent tongue flick, landing an overripe mango squarely upon a losing bettor's head.</p>\n<p>No matter the origin, variants of the game and the martial art it spawned have become mainstays in tripkee society. In contrast to other fighting styles, thlipit doesn't stand on ceremony or rigid discipline. Practitioners refer to themselves as contestants and play off the forms and moves as mere exercises or games. Despite this veneer of frivolity, thlipit can be just as dangerous in the mouth of an adept as any other weapon.</p>\n<p>Thlipit combines fluid movements reminiscent of whip fighting with the leverage of a wrestler's stance. It favors quick smacks, brief grabs, and short throws. Friend, foe, and the contestant themselves always remain in motion. Moves are often exaggerated to play up stylish elements for spectators or lure brash opponents into attacking early.</p>\n<p>No formal schools exist to teach thlipit. Many tripkees are familiar with the style from childhood games, even if they haven't developed the physicality to be considered a true contestant. Self-directed instruction remains common, though aspiring contestants will seek out veterans and ask to be taken on as apprentices. Even though this sort of self-directed instruction happens frequently, a veteran contestant will still occasionally take on a student or two to pass along particular forms or styles.</p>\n<p>Though thlipit originated with tripkees, tripkee migration to Vidrian and other population centers has exposed other peoples to the sport. Most notably, thlipit has become popular with the recent generation of iruxi youth, who have adapted it for use with a tail rather than a tongue. Though not every move is possible with a tail, they have added their own innovations to the style.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats </strong>4th @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.rTkr1EqpAN6YtnAh]{Lunge}; <strong>6th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.39CqlOzlHjEhh0E4]{Slam Down}; <strong>12th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.yTh9QwAf0hadP91j]{Crashing Slam}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LKHfdSmIg8ZNWDyc]{Thlipit Contestant Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> You have a long prehensile tongue or a tail.

If you were born a true werecreature, perhaps you don't see your condition as a curse at all, but a noble calling; alternately, maybe your upbringing in a community of evil-minded werecreatures has led you to despise your own kin and, by extension, yourself.

There is great roleplaying potential in a character whose humanoid and bestial sides contrast so dramatically that they might as well be different characters altogether!</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Speed</th>\n<th>Attack</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Traits</th>\n<th>Special</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Werebat</td>\n<td>10 feet, fly 15 feet</td>\n<td>Fangs</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>—</td>\n<td>When Flying due to the fly speed granted by this form, you must begin and end your movement on a solid surface or immediately fall.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Werebear</td>\n<td>25 feet</td>\n<td>\n<p>Jaws</p>\n<p>Claw</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>1d8 piercing</p>\n<p>1d6 slashing</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>Agile</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>—</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wereboar</td>\n<td>30 feet</td>\n<td>Tusk</td>\n<td>1d8 slashing</td>\n<td>Sweep</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Werecrocodile</td>\n<td>\n<p></p>\n<p>25 feet,</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>swim 15 feet</p>\n</td>\n<td>Jaws</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>Grapple</td>\n<td>You can hold your breath for 2 hours in animal or hybrid shape.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weremoose</td>\n<td>25 feet</td>\n<td>Antler</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>Shove</td>\n<td>—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wererat</td>\n<td>25 feet</td>\n<td>\n<p></p>\n<p>Jaws</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Claw</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p></p>\n<p>1d6 piercing</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1d4 slashing</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p></p>\n<p>Finesse</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Agile, finesse</p>\n</td>\n<td>Your animal shape is Small in size.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wereshark</td>\n<td>15 feet, swim 25 feet</td>\n<td>Jaws</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>Grapple</td>\n<td>Your hybrid shape gains the amphibious trait.

          "text": "<p>Battle harbingers are elite, specially trained members of their faith, usually carrying out missions that require extra martial prowess. Built for the battlefield and used to working alongside other warriors, as well as tackling dangerous solo operations, battle harbingers typically spend more time training outside their temples than praying within them. What they lack in spellcasting prowess they make up for with expertise in weaponry and defense.</p>\n<p>Even less combat-oriented faiths understand that battle harbingers can be a necessity, especially if there's a dangerous quest that must be undertaken alone. Because battle harbingers rigorously train their bodies to withstand hardship, they tend to have more capability to support themselves, leaving more traditional priests to handle group-wide supportive magic and prayers.</p>\n<p>Battle harbingers specialize in bolstering themselves with their deity's power and weakening their opponents in the same vein.</p>\n<p>A battle harbinger's training varies greatly from that of a typical cleric. While this training initially resembles that of a warpriest cleric, the martial and spellcasting philosophies of a battle harbinger soon differ. A battle harbinger is taught to rely less on their spells, instead focusing on a select array of spells to supplement their combat abilities. Their main magical abilities focus on battle auras, spells that create areas centered on the battle harbinger that either empower their allies or hamper their foes. Battle harbingers are generally expected to take the fight directly to a foe, and their auras supplement these tactics.</p>\n<p>The main component of a battle harbinger's training involves their battle creed. While a battle creed varies from faith to faith, the core aspects of these creeds remain the same regardless of dogma. A battle creed declares a battle harbinger to be a living weapon for their god or faith. The battle harbinger is expected to enter combat on behalf of their god and to adhere to strict training regimens that support this goal. Battle harbingers train to make use of powerful armor and their god's favored weapon. Supplemental training focuses on the body, allowing battle harbingers to stave off fatigue and dangers that target one's health directly. Some battle harbingers, such as those who follow Erastil, prefer to make use of ranged tactics, but they still learn more direct combat should the need arise.</p>\n<p>Although a battle harbinger's spellcasting capabilities are more limited than their fellow clerics, their magic generally isn't less potent. Battle harbingers are still capable of calling down strong divine power, but they rely on this magic less often than their brethren. This is mostly due to their martial training, which focuses on their bodies, combat, and defense. As such, a battle harbinger doesn't carry as much magic potential as other clerics. The exception to this is their training in battle auras, which many battle harbingers are able to make greater use of as their prowess grows.</p>\n<p>While most battle harbingers are associated with a given temple, it's not unusual for one to be a lone mercenary, enacting their deity's will along their travels and through their contract work.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>2nd</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.2xk4jdwcCfmasYfT]{Vicious Swing}; <strong>4th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.lkcM4V3VDAtjlR9P]{Intimidating Strike}, <strong>6th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.tWBK7Zbt80JlPryC]{Bespell Strikes}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.49CkgA3kj7Im6gZ5]{Battle Creed}<span style=\"float:right\">1st</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">cleric</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.49CkgA3kj7Im6gZ5 inline]</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.K7YK5ESDoreohCe8]{Battle Harbinger Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">class</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> battle creed</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have trained extensively in combat, battlefield tactics, and stamina, focusing on being an exceptional warrior for your faith in exchange for less time studying the traditional spells and scriptures.

Separated from the regular members of this obscure league of scholars and academics, you have attained divine and occult abilities through methods kept secret to outsiders. The air of mystery that surrounds you and your organization only serves to aid you in your cases, which can often be dangerous investigations into cultists and supernatural threats. However, you might have earned the suspicion or ire of others within the Order of the Palatine Eye due to your near-constant field work and the fact that initiates and lower-order members are kept in the dark about your provenance.</p>\n<p>You are likely unclear as to the exact source of your abilities. Depending on your understanding of your Order's teachings, you could have gained this power from the knowledge you gained through The Lost Gospels of Tabris. This knowledge seems to hint at greater mysteries underlying existence and the cosmos, as well as mysteries hidden between the veils of morality that suffuse the planes, which could have unlocked your potential. It could also be that you gained your abilities due to your connection to the various artifacts and relics that the Order of the Palatine Eye has collected over its lifetime. The nature of many of these items remains unclear even after decades of study, but your proximity to these relics could have triggered an awakening of abilities. Your abilities might simply function because you believe they must. It would be disastrous for you to lose access to these abilities, so you believe them to function and considerations otherwise are something you refuse to acknowledge.</p>\n<p>Regardless, you've learned to make use of your abilities to work against magical forces. These abilities allow you to tap into greater magical potential, create wards to protect yourself from magical attacks, and even grant you esoteric insight to better harm your foes. While these abilities are potent, you must also make sure to not let your Order training lapse. You make use of your mind, your canny insight, and deductive skills to deal with the various mysteries of existence that you encounter and the supernatural foes that you find along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats:</strong> <strong>6th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dVzPTpZoGSi5NR6y]{Cast Out}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.yMj9WfPctWQC7be2]{Thaumaturgic Ritualist}.</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ppGGpc3Iv2NpAhys]{Palatine Detective}<span style=\"float:right\">1st</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">investigator</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ppGGpc3Iv2NpAhys inline]</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.LlTIbv1py77nACkI]{Palatine Detective Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">class</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>You have delved into the study of the occult and divine, becoming exceptionally skilled at identifying when such forces are at work.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the mightiest empire to the smallest star, everything dies. Lowly mortals, ageless angels, and primordial gods all face the same inescapable fate—to fade beyond memory and join the litany of the forgotten. The hastening of all life into this oblivion is the ultimate goal of the daemonic harbingers and their forces, including those mortals who exploit hate and hopelessness to bring calamity on the world. Chief among these demigods are the Riders of the Apocalypse, powerful fiends chosen to deliver death, famine, pestilence, and war.</p>\n<p>While neither the Riders nor their devotees feel obligated to make or keep promises, some mortals pledge their efforts to gain personal power and further the cause of entropy. Those destined to wreak the most destruction upon the world are known as apocalypse riders. Taking on such a mantle requires the utmost commitment to death and ruin.</p>\n<p>You are such an apocalypse rider, and you have a terrifying ally in this fight, whether sent by daemonic overlords or spontaneously formed by Abaddon itself. This creature is a beastly mount with a form that matches your personality and goals, though its loyalties lie with Abaddon first. It will serve you faithfully as long as you continue to cause significant losses of life and inflict mass destruction. However, this apocalypse mount is more than just a way to monitor your obedience to the cause of misery. Your mount serves as a badge of office, signifying to daemons that you are effectively one of them.</p>\n<p>From astride her ferocious riding drake, <strong>Arba Dwindletree</strong> (destructive female gnome druid) staves off her Bleaching by wreaking havoc on crops and pitting fledgling settlements in the River Kingdoms against one another. Her delight in this chaos is tempered only when meddlesome fey creatures try to join in on the “fun.”</p>\n<p>Posing as an Order of the Nail Hellknight, <strong>Owyn Darkoath</strong> (manipulative male human warrior) pushes border tensions between Andoran and Cheliax, riding a pitch black destrier into battle. His goal is to force default on the Thrunes' contract with Hell, bringing even greater war when Asmodeus' forces come to collect what they're owed.</p>\n<p><strong>Deng Fo-Murk</strong> (cruel male human necromancer) uses his alchemical skills to reanimate the corpses of nobles and diplomats to sew political conflict between Hwanggot and its neighbors. He is poised to light the fuse on a powder keg of bloody consequences, through which he will gallop through on his terror bird mount.</p>\n<p>In Abaddon, daemonkind sometimes demonstrates an odd mix of cooperation and hostility toward one another. This remains true of their mortal champions in the Universe. War creates both famine and pestilence, drought creates war, and all worshippers of the end of all things engineer death in one form or another. An apocalypse rider may specialize in a particular rubric of death, but all daemonic servitors understand that the categories of the Four Riders frequently overlap one another. A group of riders might even cooperate to increase the scale of their deadly designs, but their apocalypse mounts carefully track who is delivering on their oath and who is not.</p>\n<p>Apocalypse riders who fulfill the full scope of their commitment to the Riders often prove to be among the mightiest creatures on their world. Such servants of death are hardly sated once a project reaches its desired number of casualties. Successful riders often indulge in a new sort of killing or initiate a plan larger and more lethal in scope than their original commitments. A truly ambitious apocalypse rider will turn their baleful gaze to their own master, enforcing one of the few dogmas observed by daemonkind—all creatures must die, including those immortal demigods who remain unchallenged for too many centuries. Several times over the millennia, an apocalypse rider or exalted deacon has laid waste to a presiding Rider and claimed the daemon's post. An individual who assumes the office of Rider immediately becomes a unique daemon and takes over the realm of the previous Rider on the plane of Abaddon.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>Your Personal Apocalypse</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Often your apocalypse mount brings with it a command to start a war or drive a nation to lasting hunger, but the Four Riders of the Apocalypse and their daemonic servants leave the nature of the calamity to you, their new champion. The daemons demand only that the resulting evil be historic in scope and unique in its nature. All mortals can start a war by virtue of hatred or greed; an apocalypse rider's war must offer something new. Apocalypse riders often demonstrate a significant degree of finesse as they engineer destruction. Servants of the Rider of Famine might employ magic to control the weather, breed a more voracious swarm of locusts, poison the soil or a city's water supply, or employ economics to hoard a food supply away from hungry mouths. Each Rider's promise offers multiple opportunities to bring calamity to bear, and every apocalypse rider has full authority to shape events for their desired effect.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dpkGYM2QObR5QbBH]{Apocalypse Rider Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">destiny</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the darkest hour of the night, a fearsome and terrible steed arrives as a gift from a powerful daemonic patron.

By continuing to fight against the machinations of the wicked, you can eventually ascend to become a divine being in your own right. When you face seemingly insurmountable challenges to save lives and communities, combat evil, and slay dangerous monsters, you further prove your worthiness.</p>\n<p>Ascended celestials commonly rise from obscurity during times of great upheaval or in regions in dire peril. During the Age of Lost Omens, ascended celestials are on the rise, as devastating disasters like the Eye of Abendego and the opening of the Worldwound spread chaos and destruction across Golarion. Other ascended celestials face more political threats as the rule of tyrannical villains like the Black Triune, Geb, Queen Abrogail Thrune II, Walkena, and Tar-Baphon continue uncontested.</p>\n<p>Yet for every great evil, a hero rises. In Iblydos, many of the hero-gods, brave souls who strive to achieve their destinies, might be considered ascended celestials. In shadowy Nidal, a Desnan priestess secretly spreads hope and light and plots to break the rule of the Black Triune. In Ustalav, a brave scientist sneaks out at night, destroying undead predators with clever inventions and wisdom gained from folktales. In the shattered ruins of Azlant, an azarketi diver retrieves fragments of an ancient weapon to wield in their fight against the alghollthu veiled masters of the ocean depths.</p>\n<p>As Deskari, demon lord of infestations and locusts, attempted to spread the Worldwound across the surface of Avistan, <strong>Queen Galfrey</strong> (heroic female human herald), ruler of Mendev, and her closest allies rose up to stop him, bringing an end to the Fifth Mendevian Crusade. Queen Galfrey became an ascended celestial upon the closure of the Worldwound, rising to the celestial ranks as Iomedae s herald.</p>\n<p>The Tian Xia nation of Tianjing was once the site of a great war between qlippoths and celestials. Triumphant against the fiends, the heavenly host remained in the Universe to repair the landscape and protect it from further incursion.</p>\n<p>When mortals began to populate the area, the celestials entrusted them with guardianship, establishing magical seals that would keep the qlippoths at bay. Today, though, these seals are beginning to weaken, and a young acolyte named <strong>Chogyel</strong> (diligent nonbinary human nephilim priest) has begun to notice strange signs of supernatural activity in Tamdrin Vale. Their faith will soon be tested, putting them on the path toward becoming an ascended celestial.</p>\n<p>As many generations of the nation of Holomog have been exposed to celestial energy, the population of nephilim is larger than average. <strong>Ghunda Gutrim</strong> (boisterous male ganzi musician) patrols the border of the Field of Maidens to rescue and lift the spirits of those who accidentally wandered into the haunted area.</p>\n<p>You count yourself among these heroes with the potential to become ascended celestials. Whether you battle wickedness with righteous might, inspire your community to perform worthy acts of charity, or act in secret against a rising tide of darkness, your actions result in making the world a better place. You are likely humble about these accomplishments, performing them not out of a desire for glory, but from a place of compassion and empathy. You may not even be aware that you ve garnered the metaphysical attention of the celestial realms. Others, though, can see the holy light that radiates from your person, if not physically, then spiritually. Until your eventual ascension, you continue to work for the greater good, no matter who or what stands in your way.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>What is a Celestial?</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>There are four primary categories of celestials: agathions, angels, archons, and azatas.</p>\n<p><strong>Agathions</strong> reside in Nirvana and have animal-like aspects, such as anthropomorphic forms or the ability to shapeshift into animals. They're born from the souls of mortals who attained enlightenment in life, and they aim to aid mortals by subtly guiding them to finding their own enlightenment. They're the most likely celestials to meddle in everyday mortal affairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Angels</strong> are the messengers and emissaries of the celestial hosts and are divided into choirs based on their abilities and purviews. Most live in Nirvana, though they can also be found in Elysium and Heaven, and they often visit the Universe.</p>\n<p><strong>Archons</strong> are the guardians and soldiers of Heaven. They fight corruption and evil, uphold order, and inspire mortals to act with honor. Archons rarely interfere with mortals, save to pass judgment on notably wicked people, instead focusing on greater evils—fiends and their followers.</p>\n<p><strong>Azatas</strong> are manifestations of freedom who reside in the wilds of Elysium. They're joyful, passionate, and artistic, with a flair for the dramatic. Azatas are unlikely to meddle in mortal affairs, lest their inference infringe upon the freedoms of those they aid.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.zDmc6JlvdVzHEtcE]{Ascended Celestial Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">destiny</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Calling has driven you to perform mortal deeds that will result in your ascension to the ranks of celestials.

          "name": "Beast Lord (Uncommon)",
          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tales of connections between man and creature are numerous across the lands, often carrying with them legends of the exploits of companions as they protect that which is dearest to them. A beast lord is defined by their bond with their companion, an unshakable union that cannot be broken. This link can be brought forth through deific intervention, a traumatic shared event between companions that solidified their connection in magic, or even simply through a powerful friendship.</p>\n<p>A beast lord is not simply a title by which to measure those who unite with their companions, it is a collective merging of minds and souls. It's been proposed that while the heart of one companion still beats, the other's cannot cease, two drums in a perpetual song forever destined to be together as one. Stories of beast lords see them arising from their long-lost or secret dens to protect the lands, other companions, or lost members of their domains even long after most believed them dead and gone. These legends suggest that while even one life still lives, regardless of how many generations have passed, a beast lord can return to defend, and sometimes lead, those under their protection.</p>\n<p>While this archetype is called “beast lord,” your companion need not be an animal. A wizened druid might preach the Green Faith alongside a similarly weathered arboreal companion. An elven ranger might patrol the skies above their forest home on a riding drake. An ingenious inventor might construct a robotic ally to aid in his workshop. What is important is that the beast lord has a strong bond with a companion, and that the two work hand-in-hand, almost sharing one mind.</p>\n<p>Across the Inner Sea Region, <strong>Adowyn</strong> (untamed female human hunter) and <strong>Leryn</strong> (protective male wolf companion) travel protecting sacred natural lands and hunting those unfortunate enough to draw their ire. Their most recent exploits involved stopping an illegal strip-mining operation in the foothills of the Mindspin Mountains.</p>\n<p>In the Mwangi Expanse, a young kobold named of <strong>Vidni</strong> (charismatic nonbinary kobold merchant) travels in hopes of selling their varied wares, keeping their most trusted friend and bodyguard Hew (fearsome male gorilla companion) close. The two have found some success in Senghor, and are saving up to buy their first trading ship.</p>\n<p>In the Verduran Forest of Avistan, <strong>Gal</strong> (clever female centaur ranger) moves hoof in hoof with her boar companion <strong>Jinx</strong> (steadfast female boar companion), plunging tusk and arrow into the hearts of any would-be intruders. They are friendly with the local druids who reside on the Isle of Arenway, but aren't beholden to their politics.</p>\n<p>In Alkenstar, the inventor <strong>Dr. Ashley Arrowbaud</strong> (distractable female human inventor) labored for years within her laboratory until she one day emerged with a large, arthropod-shaped metal creature marked <strong>SC-04910</strong> (sturdy genderless construct companion) who almost has a will of its own. The two have recently begun to discover the sinister actions of a secret society that includes members of the administration of Dr. Arrowbaud's alma mater, Blythir College.</p>\n<p>Any of these characters may be, or may one day become, beast lords. By sharing a deep connection and the same goals, each pair may find a cause or quest that is important to them, which could eventually transform them into figures of legend. Tales of their exploits may inspire a similar connection in others, who might soon become another beast lord.</p>\n<p>You have forged your own union with a loyal companion. The two of you share every burden, every strife, and a clear destiny. That future, no matter what foes you face, lands you protect, or quests you pursue, always shares the commonality of your undying connection to each other. Though there will be enemies who seek to drive you apart or even send you into the hands of Pharasma, they will not be able to dissolve your partnership as long as you and your companion remain true to one another. You are one unit, one body and one mind, and the tribulations and trials set against you will quickly crumble through the power of your union.</p>\n<p>You need not travel alone, though others won't truly understand the connection you have with one another. You and your companion may make other friends or even form intimate relationships outside of this bond. Those ties will always be secondary, however, and that may cause some jealousy or resentment. But nothing like that will ever drive a wedge between you and your companion. Those who shun or ostracize you for your bond will eventually see its power when you rise to become figures of myth whose stories will be told for the rest of eternity.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>We are one Life, United for Eternity</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The beast lord mythic destiny is themed around a character who has united with a companion, making them two halves of a whole. While this may be a union between a single animal, your union could be formed with another type of companion. Your soul might be united with a bear you once sought to kill, forever bonded after a fierce battle. Perhaps you're revered as the matron wolf to a pup that follows your discerning leadership. Maybe you're the creator of a metal construct, whose internal programming is tethered to your deepest emotions.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wherever tyrants abuse their power, rebels soon follow, fighting against their oppression in disorganized and sporadic outbursts, often easily quashed by the tyrant, whose power grows yet stronger. But on rare occasions, one among the ranks of the rebels rises above and beyond to meet the tyrant at their level and lights the spark of an unstoppable revolutionary passion among their people, leading them to outmaneuver and eventually overpower their oppressor. Even should they fall at the hands of the tyrant's forces, their martyrdom will inflame the movement, inspiring another to take on the mantle, for a broken chain's greatest power is their bond to their movement.</p>\n<p>Some bards yet tell tales of broken chains who, unwilling to give up the fight against a tyrant, broke the bonds which destiny had over their mortality, and quite literally came back to life in the body of another fervent follower of the cause. A few who have claimed the mantle of broken chain whisper to their closest friends that they have prevented a terrible death from occurring by somehow turning back the hands of time; witnessing this event has haunted their nightmares ever since, and they worry that they have somehow incurred the wrath of fate itself.</p>\n<p>The five-winged angel <strong>Thais</strong> , Cayden Cailean's herald, embodies freedom and courage. She has gone as far as to fight the ruler of nine Hells, Asmodeus, to liberate one thousand innocent souls who were tricked into the clutches of hell by a vaguely worded diabolical contract. In the process, she paid a personal sacrifice: the loss of one of her feathery wings.</p>\n<p>In Galt, the poets and philosophers <strong>Darl Jubannich</strong> (inspirational male human poet) and <strong>Hosetter</strong> (deceased male aiuvarin philosopher) led the people to revolt and fight against House Thrune, eventually forming the Revolutionary Council to rule the newly independent nation of Galt. Little did they know their lofty ideals would be turned against them when the council executed Hosetter with one of their final blade guillotines, trapping the philosopher's soul. Fearing for his own life, Jubannich fled the country.</p>\n<p>In Ravounel, a mysterious group of champions of the people called the Silver Ravens overthrew Barzillai Thrune to establish the new country, independent from Cheliax. Many claim they were aided by a band of adventurers whose names have never been discovered, but whose contributions were vital to the cause.</p>\n<p>The Bright Lions of Mzali, lead by the devout <strong>Sihar</strong> (revolutionary female human fighter), wage a cloak-and-dagger war of attrition against the forces of the tyrannical God-King Walkena. Sihar has also revived the worship of the Old Sun Gods, a trio of deities once forgotten.</p>\n<p>Any of these individuals may be considered broken chains, destined to bring low a powerful tyrant or system of oppression and light a flame of liberty that will reverberate across history.</p>\n<p>Which oppressive regime or ruler you will bring down is up to you. Leading your roused band of rebels, no unjust bond will survive for long, and evil despots across the land will quake in their boots at your passionate fury's advance. They will send spycatchers against your infiltrated saboteurs, deadly assassins to assail your key allies, and even the full might of a nation's army. You must heed the call to lead your movement against these threats and be brave enough to take on as much of the burden of danger as you can. Inspire your followers, protect them from harm, and lead them to freedom.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>Lightning the Flame of Liberty</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The broken chain mythic destiny tells of characters who will lead a revolution against an oppressive tyrant or system, inspiring those who follow to become an unstoppable force for liberty. Oppression can appear in all places and take many forms, and so your broken chain's journey will likely be unpredictable. From freeing those who are physically enslaved from their chains and manacles, to fighting insidious (but legal) economic hardships, to mentally liberating a people fooled into complacency, broken chains must face the underhanded machinations of tyrants as they come. The only constants in their journey are their unwavering resolve in the face of brutal repression, and the people they inspire through fervent ideas and daring action.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.4vR3Z6B60cjpQ7xW]{Broken Chain Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">destiny</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Calling was sparked by your outrage at tyrants, after having witnessed a brutal act of oppression that you could no longer abide.

If you break this anathema, you lose access to abilities granted by this archetype until you atone or make amends.</p>\n<p>Your GM has final say about what constitutes oppression, which can be a difficult and sometimes nebulous concept. In general, oppression is the cruel and unjust use of authority or power. Some examples include performing acts of violence against those without power, removing an individual's agency through mind control magic, and engaging in organized mistreatment or exploitation of others. When the members of a royal guard assault a beggar just to get him off the street, that is oppression. When a tax collector levies higher charges against the less fortunate because it's the law, they are participating in a system of oppression.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder

That grand thing that reaches us all, the consequence of life. The shadow cast by light. Do you ever consider your death? Do you ever think about the life that follows it? Pick up your blade, warrior. If your death is won in glory, you will be remembered for all time. That is the true path to immortality.</p>\n<p>Woven into the threads of all cultures and traditions are various heroic champions, whose epic battles and martial exploits are sung of in hymns and sea shanties, whispered in hushed reverent tones, or sometimes deified and sacrificed to with burnt offerings. To be an eternal legend is to be one of these heroes. Whether with blade, bow, or fist, your deeds will live forever through stories and poems, your very essence woven into the fabric of the universe.</p>\n<p>Think of a grand warrior, whose deeds of valor are witnessed by peons and infantry soldiers, the stories of which are then passed down to their friends and family back home. That warrior s name might be altered or mangled in the process, but he will be remembered all the same. The way his blade captured the light of the sun, the way his mien was that of a mighty king or celestial. When he is inevitably slain by the one stronger than him (for there will always be someone stronger), he will die with a grin. For his blade will become a sacred treasure upon which nations will be founded, his name the bedrock of religions. But for now, his entrance into a tavern is met with hushed whispers that he returns with a gregarious wink. Or perhaps his passage through this world goes unheeded until that fateful day he joins the ranks of the dead.</p>\n<p>Ponder <strong>The Old Man</strong> (wise male human herald), whose real name has been forgotten, replaced by an epithet. Did he ever have a real name? As a herald of the god Irori, The Old Man has helped many monks achieve their full potential and been the inspiration for several fighting styles. But don t let his wizened appearance fool you. His fists are as hard as stone, his movements as swift as the wind. Do not cross The Old Man if you wish for all your bones to remain unbroken and your skin unbruised.</p>\n<p>Consider <strong>Torman Iates</strong> (risk-taking male human nomarch), renowned gladiator of Absalom. After emerging triumphant from countless battles within the Irorium arena, the grizzled human has parlayed his fame into successful careers as a tavern owner and local politician. He sits as a nomarch on the Low Council of Absalom, where he helps pass legislation to aid ex-fighters like himself. Because of this, Torman is respected and well-liked by those who fight for coin.</p>\n<p>Contemplate the grand traveling warrior <strong>Halimess</strong> (ferocious female dromaar freedom fighter), whose cloak is made of white tiger pelt, whose helm is plated with the scales of dragons, and whose blades are crafted from the teeth of deep-sea leviathans. She travels the land not slaying monsters, but helping commoners, standing up to tyrants, and working the fields when others cannot. She is rarely forced to unsheathe her blade, but when she does, her legend grows. Many intelligent monsters even fear her approach.</p>\n<p>Suppose that any of these individuals are—or have the potential to be—eternal legends. They are unforgettable paragons of might and unmatched exemplars of finesse. In the face of insurmountable odds, they stand with conviction and determination. In that vein, you have answered the call of the eternal legend. Your life will not be an easy one; no, you will face tribulations. You will end most of your days with aching muscles and the blood of your foes drying upon your armor. Your battles will be like songs sung amidst storms—the pounding of a drum mixing with the rumble of thunder. Hold steadfast your weapon, clench tightly your fist, and tales of your exploits will become the myths of tomorrow!</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>The Unforgotten Blade</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The eternal legend mythic destiny is themed around a character whose mighty deeds will be continually told of in traditional songs, bedtime stories, and local legends. The hero's exploits may get exaggerated or misattributed, but what matters is the spirit of the tale: an individual whose strength, agility, cunning, or wisdom allowed them to perform seemingly impossible tasks or prevail against insurmountable odds. These stories often give hope to those who might be struggling in their lives, hoping one day that the hero will return to save them. Or, more importantly, spurring them to perform their own great deeds!</p>\n<p>While many of the feats in this destiny revolve around battle prowess, your tales need not only be the clashing of blades and the spilling of blood. Perhaps you once took down a tyrant with a single well-placed word. Perhaps you won a drinking contest against an entire garrison of soldiers to free a captive ally.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Golarion has seen more than one mortal experience apotheosis and ascend to the ranks of its many deities.</p>\n<p>Some of the most famous of such individuals are the Ascended, the deities who achieved divinity through the power of the Starstone . However, many current deities found ways to ascend without the aid of a magical meteorite, instead carving their own path to greatness through their deeds and actions.Irori, god of enlightenment, dedicated his mortal life to the pursuit of self-perfection and achieved godhood through personal perfection of his own mind, body, and spirit, a deed that was later accomplished by his nephew Gruhastha, as well. Nethys, god of magic, attained such immense mastery of magic as a mortal that he was able to witness everything that transpired across every plane of existence, an accomplishment that fueled his own divine ascension.</p>\n<p>Godlings are mythic beings whose actions or circumstances propel them along similar paths to these ascended mortals, using their mythic power to elevate themselves to a higher existence. Aided by their hierophants, mortal allies who share in the godling s power, these beings travel Golarion, building their personal legends and paving their own path to divinity.</p>\n<p>The wizard <strong>Razmir</strong> (arrogant male human would-be-god) pursues divinity and immortality by whatever means he can acquire it, in locales across the Inner Sea both obvious and obscure.</p>\n<p>In the Mwangi Expanse, it is believed that members of Old-Mage Jatembe's Ten Magic Warriors still linger as immortal demigods, and that those they choose as their hierophants are candidates to receive the title of Magic Warrior themselves.</p>\n<p>On the continent of Arcadia, in the region known as the Deadshot Lands, <strong>Steel at Dawn</strong> (compassionate female human gunslinger) and her sidekick hierophant <strong>Nibbub</strong> (plucky male chuspiqui scout) travel from remote community to remote community, protecting travelers from bandits and monsters while collecting an ever-growing congregation of grateful worshippers.</p>\n<p>Any of these characters might be, or might become, godlings. Less than demigods but closer to true godhood than an exemplar, godlings wield mythic power while sharing divine magic to pursue and accomplish their goals.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is that drives you to transcend mortality and walk among the immortals is for you to decide. The pull of divinity can cause you to become disconnected from mortal concerns, but your hierophant is there to keep you grounded and connected to the mortal world.</p>\n<p>This will be the most essential and important of the relationships you develop as you pursue your adventures, for your hierophant serves as a reminder of where you have come from and acts as a critical ally in helping you become the god you seek to be. Most hierophants become the first high priest of a godling who achieves full divinity, and some may even become a herald or similarly powerful ally.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>The Ever-Changing Path</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Godhood is a destination sought by many but achieved by few. Even relatively well-known paths to deification, like passing the Test of the Starstone in Absalom, are never achieved in exactly the same way twice. For some, the transition to godly status is sudden and unexpected, while for others it is the stated goal of a long and intentional journey.</p>\n<p>One mortal who famously ascended to godhood was the gnome Nivi Rhombodazzle, who journeyed into the Darklands and had many adventures there before retrieving a precious gem and trading it to Torag in exchange for divinity. This story does raise some interesting questions, though. What item could be so precious yet so elusive that Torag would entrust a shiftless mortal to retrieve it? Was Nivi's ascension truly a gift from Torag, or was it perhaps the journey itself that granted Nivi her divinity, with Torag merely setting her on a path that would inevitably take her to her desired destination?</p>\n<p>If the stone were a mythic artifact akin to the Starstone, it's possible that the act of retrieving it was enough to imbue Nivi with the divine spark that would enable her transcendence. If such were the case, then perhaps Torag demanding that Nivi seek it out and deliver it to him was a way for the dwarven god to ensure that this cunning creature destined for greatness would only reach her goals after a final act of humility to temper her pride.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.102gdaYHnMFoDRL1]{Godling Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">destiny</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Calling allows you to begin walking the path to true deific ascension, inspiring followers as your divine seed grows. Your first follower is your hierophant—the high priest of your new faith—whom you rely on to spread your word and provide an anchoring mortal presence as your perspectives are increasingly pulled toward the cosmic. When you gain this feat, choose one willing ally to be your hierophant. If your hierophant is not trained in spell attack modifier and spell DC, they become trained for as long as they are your designated hierophant. If your hierophant dies or chooses to part ways with you, you can designate a new hierophant by communing with the chosen ally for a period of 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Your Calling allows you to seize the divine magic typically restricted to deities. Choose one domain to claim from the list on Player Core, or from other domains you have access to. You learn the initial domain spell for this domain. You gain a pool of Focus Points with 1 Focus Point and you can Refocus by taking 10 minutes to replenish your divine energy from the planes beyond. You gain expert proficiency in spell modifier and spell DC, and your spellcasting ability for these spells is your choice of Wisdom or Charisma, decided when you gain this feat.</p>\n<p>Your hierophant also gains the Cast a Spell activity and can cast the domain spell you learned with Godling Dedication. When they Cast the Spell in this way, your Focus Point is expended as the cost of the spell. Your hierophant uses their own spellcasting proficiency in spell modifier and spell DC when casting a spell in this way, and they use their own Wisdom or Charisma modifier (matching your choice). If your hierophant has mythic power, they can spend a Mythic Point to cast any divine spell they gain by being your hierophant at mythic proficiency.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.6rGdm00nWbS267LF]{Claim Cardinal Domains} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.6rGdm00nWbS267LF inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.frPdltbxoYtAHpPX]{Divine Invulnerability} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.frPdltbxoYtAHpPX inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ttWl0hOh9cdk7Zko]{Receive Prayers} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 14</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">concentrate</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mental</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ttWl0hOh9cdk7Zko inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sUMrRRFsHiJf4VXP]{Absolve Sins} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">concentrate</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mental</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.sUMrRRFsHiJf4VXP inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.KVF2c1ixGkbG6Idi]{Font of Life or Death} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.KVF2c1ixGkbG6Idi inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pGIJ6iXyg2CRzQxb]{Gird Champion} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 16</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.pGIJ6iXyg2CRzQxb inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.lL5MxRUFqbzS6jDm]{Pass Vengeful Judgment} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">sanctified</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.lL5MxRUFqbzS6jDm inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ZTI12qEjht0pQuaB]{Sanctified Relic} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.ZTI12qEjht0pQuaB inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.S2YTLXTvqaXhThG6]{Stymie the Gods} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 18</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.S2YTLXTvqaXhThG6 inline hr=false]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.MfolzkTNi6V4XQ7J]{Assume Godhood} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 20</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.MfolzkTNi6V4XQ7J inline]</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Source: Pathfinder War of Immortals</em></span></p>"

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many lands and cultures have generational stories of an exceptional leader, a person who appeared in a time of great need to forge a kingdom and protect it against all incursions, bringing peace and prosperity. Stories abound that these “prophesied monarchs” will return when they're needed, defying the barriers of time and death to ensure the safety of their people. Though destiny and prophecy have long since been broken on Golarion, these individuals persist, either through force of will, the power of the stories surrounding them, or some other divine quirk that ensures their pseudo-immortality.</p>\n<p>True prophesied monarchs can be recognized by the knights who always accompany them. Mystical bonds of fate or strange magic tie the prophesied monarch and their knights together, ensuring that they'll always find each other when they or their kingdom need them most.</p>\n<p>It would be fair to say that a prophesied monarch's true power lies not in the impact of their decrees or the strength of their sword arm, but in the quality of their knights. Some knights might one day even be called upon to take up a fallen monarch's mantle, protecting their legacy even after death. Regardless of the nature of a prophesied monarch's knights, the bonds between them are practically unbreakable, and the power of their union is virtually unstoppable, defying demons, death, and perhaps even the gods themselves.</p>\n<p>While this archetype refers to “knights” and “kingdoms,” the nature of a prophesied monarch's chosen companions and ruled territory can vary greatly. A ferocious pirate captain might treat her ship as her kingdom and her most loyal crewmates as her knights. A pious cleric might consider their church and parishioners their kingdom and the priests who serve alongside them as the knights sworn to protect the same. A bandit outlaw might consider the woods he haunts his kingdom and the scurrilous brigands who fight alongside him his knights. What's important is that the monarch has a territory or dominion they can claim as their own and a band of bonded allies who help enforce that claim.</p>\n<p>In Casmaron, stories of the ancient hero-god <strong>Namzaruum</strong> (prophesied male human hero-god) tell of the day he'll awaken from his long rest in the Hall of Slumbering Kings to lead a new Azlanti empire.</p>\n<p>In the land of Ustalav, rumors abound in the frontiers and forests of a man calling himself <strong>Arnisant</strong> (mysterious male human knight), who hunts undead alongside a band of stalwart knights.</p>\n<p>In the Fangwood Forest of Nirmathas, a jolly archer named <strong>Relkin</strong> (mirthful male human ranger) guards his abode from undead, Molthuni troops, and Nirmathan militias alike, assisted by a knavish group of bandits with hearts of gold.</p>\n<p>In the Shackles, Hurricane Queen <strong>Tessa Fairwind</strong> (fearsome female aiuvarin pirate) and her crew rule over a kingdom of salt and blood.</p>\n<p>In the Isles of the Empty Courts, off the eastern shore of Arcadia, there lies a table surrounded by thrones upon which sit the bodies of nine ancient rulers. It's said that when the isles need them most, they shall awaken to usher in a new age.</p>\n<p>Any of these characters might be, or might one day become, prophesied monarchs, rulers whose legendary stories grow before them, establishing an immortal and incomparable dynasty that will long outlast their mortal life.</p>\n<p>Whatever self-made prophecy you might fulfill or kingdom you might rule is for you to decide. With your noble knights beside you, villains and monsters are sure to fall, and no hero will stay fallen long when their stalwart companions are close by to lift them to their feet. You'll almost certainly face dragons and dark wizards and all manner of fell beasts. You'll be called on to lift up those who look to you, no matter the personal cost to be paid. Trust in your knights, believe in your people, and rule with honor.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>A Monarch without at Throne</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The prophesied monarch mythic destiny is themed around a character who'll one day claim a kingdom of their own and protect it alongside their loyal knights. While much of the prophesied monarch alludes to castles and armored heroes with swords, your kingdom and your knights can be almost anything you want them to be. Perhaps you're the ringmaster of a traveling circus that serves as your kingdom, with a doughty strongman as your most stalwart knight. Maybe you're a gunslinging outlaw whose kingdom is the seedy underbelly of Alkenstar and whose knights are the fellow members of your bank-robbing gang. What's important is that you always have a place you're known and respected in, a band of loyal allies willing to aid you in its defense, and legendary challenges to overcome.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Y1hwTaDIIBKtSCZe]{Prophesied Monarch Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 12</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">destiny</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">mythic</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your Calling has culminated in a destiny of rulership, and you're able to forge a mythic bond with noble knights whose destinies become intertwined with your own.

This power isn't distributed evenly, however. Ley lines, mana droughts, and magic storms represent areas where this power waxes and wanes.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters usually use tiny fragments of this power in defined, controlled ways, but a few can draw greater amounts than what normal spells require, channeling this energy to fuel diverse effects.</p>\n<p>You've tapped into a nigh-unlimited well of magical energy and become so attuned to it that magic flows through the fabric of your being, a trickle of mystic power constantly radiating from you. You might have reached this state through intense study, years of meditation, revelation, as a gift from a powerful entity, or just through the natural progression of your inherent abilities. By accessing this raw power, you can raise the ambient level of magical energy and use it to empower, alter, and hinder spells nearby.</p>\n<p>Wildspells are surrounded by faintly visible evidence of their connection, though the precise nature of the manifestation varies with the nature of their magic.</p>\n<p>Some have a faint aura that makes colors more intense, others are shadowed by barely perceptible smoke, and others might have garments or hair constantly moving, seemingly of their own accord. Places long inhabited by a wildspell are often home to strange occurrences: small objects animating, weather altered by their mood, plants growing larger, animals with unnatural colorations, and so on.</p>\n<p>Wildspells revel in the use of their abilities, knowing that the power they tap into sets them above lesser casters. Most wildspells seek out new ways to shape the energies they unleash, knowing that their control is their only limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Alejandro the Green</strong> (excitable male human druid) poured out raw magic into his forest refuge in the River Kingdoms, over time causing the trees to walk and attracting hordes of curious fey from the First World. With the help of these newly made arboreals and fey visitors, he's been able to drive out numerous hostile invaders. However, his wild magic has recently attracted the attention of malevolent proteans from the Maelstrom, and he'll need more allies than he currently has to keep his home safe from their unpredictable predations.</p>\n<p><strong>Ernhilda Truestone</strong> (patient female dwarf sorcerer) used her wildspell powers to create an oasis of stable magic in the Mana Wastes, allowing her to give succor to harried travelers. Her home in the wastes grew to a bustling trading post, protected by her powers, though it rapidly faded after her passing. Some believe that Ernhilda's spirit now resides in a cave somewhere under the settlement and that she could be brought back to life with the proper ritual. Finding the proper site for such magic has been hindered by the subterranean tunnels, which seem to shift randomly and without warning.</p>\n<p>Teachers at the Magaambya are concerned about a young student named <strong>Mkosa</strong> (curious nonbinary halfling student) who has begun to exhibit signs of being a nascent wildspell. They don't wish to hinder Mkosa's education but are afraid of accidental explosions of magic harming others. The teachers haven't informed Mkosa about their worries, and the time to make a decision is rapidly approaching.</p>\n<p>Power and magic are yours to unleash, but only time will tell if you can master them to become a true wildspell. You'll undergo trials of the spirit and body that have every chance of breaking you, either tearing your flesh apart with unfiltered magic or breaking your mind with arcane revelations about the Universe. If you survive, your story will be one for the legends.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"text-align:center\">\n<th>The Source of Magic</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The wildspell is only for spellcasters, specifically spellcasters who cast spells from spell slots, whether spontaneously or prepared.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You follow in the footsteps of Isthralei, an old god of Sarkoris dedicated to protecting and assisting travelers in return for a story of their journey. Though tales of Isthralei himself are scarce, his gifts are still sometimes given to those who protect travelers and collect their stories.</p>\n<p>This tradition of chronicling, relearned from the ghost of a Sarkorian storyteller, has flourished at the Academy of the Reclamation. Many students who enter the Sarkoris Scar now travel under Isthralei's name, both believing in the god's purpose and using his rediscovery as a symbol of the Reclamation's successes. Even that may be too small a scope, however, as travelers' tales come from far and wide. Many campfire chroniclers collect stories of other students who have returned to Sarkoris from afar, along with the stories of their families who were scattered following the opening of the Worldwound.</p>\n<p>The mysterious benefactor accepts all stories with a listening ear, leading to many late night discussions among students about what truths might be hidden in tall tales and outright fabrications. Although Isthralei accepts falsehoods without comment, he places no requirement on the chroniclers to do the same. In fact, Isthralei has yet to provide guidance beyond the comforting warmth of his protection after stories are offered.</p>\n<p>Although Sarkorian traditions don't place importance on dividing their gods by power level or origin, some at the Academy of the Reclamation have begun to dig deeper into each of the gods' individual circumstances. The question of where Isthralei came from has become a particularly popular one among students who hope that a god who so loves the stories of travelers wouldn't take offense at his own story being exposed.</p>\n<p>Students prying into these matters have found some success using magical sources of information. Most recently, Cobyslarni's Echo Repository has revealed several tales of travelers and explorers who encountered a smiling figure far from any habitation. The reoccurring theme of weary travelers being offered a space next to the campfire in exchange for their tales has led several students to suggest that the wanderer is actually Isthralei. Unfortunately, the sightings are so vastly spread—occurring between continents, in the First World of the fey, or even on elemental planes—that they've provided little illumination of the god's origins.</p>\n<p>At the academy, Isthralei's philosophy has expanded to include tenets to protect travelers' freedom of movement, be generous to others when possible, and seek wisdom in the experience of others. Although these aren't strictly necessary to gain or keep Isthralei's favor, it's difficult to find a teacher among the Academy of the Reclamation without agreeing to these tenets.</p>\n<p>This philosophy of protecting travelers is generally seen to include the Convocation's guests in Nerosyan. Isthralei's campfire chroniclers are among the most obvious representatives of their academy and the Convocation as a whole. Although surviving tales of the old god inspire campfire conversations on the exhibit grounds, his followers also listen to stories in bars, cafes, and the schools' lodgings.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Feats: 8th</strong> @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.uR44wELN9OlU68cL]{Advanced Domain}</p>\n<h2>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.MFsCCVgU0z4N9bmY]{Campfire Chronicler Dedication} <span style=\"float:right\">Feat 2</span></h2>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity uncommon\">Uncommon</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">archetype</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">dedication</li>\n<li>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You've gained Isthralei's attention and can now offer stories up to him, either passing on your own stories or collecting those of travelers as he did.

These thespians are capable of mimicking Taldor's vast array of stage-immortalized luminaries via vivid impressions, awe-inspiring vocal performances, and wild stunts that defy all expectations. The Academy's foremost instructors and senior Lion Blades agents keep a close eye on all prodigies who show a sliver of this potential, helping them harness their talents for use in both the acting world and the world of spycraft.</p>\n<p>Through Taldor's long history, a handful of classic roles have been repeated and hammered into shape until they became icons and metaphors that define the art of Taldor. Although some of these are symbols of national strength, like First Emperor Taldaris, many are tragic or even comedic figures like Emperor Beldam I. Accepting any one of these roles in a high-profile production can be the highlight of an actor's career, but the best of the best gather these roles like trophies.</p>\n<p>Newer roles are added to the canon very slowly, with modern figures like Grand Princess Eutropia usually alluded to with references from other roles.

          "text": "<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag rarity rare\">Rare</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's a balance in blood. The arteries send surges of the fresh, life-giving liquid to the furthest reaches of the body, even as the veins return spent blood to be renewed. Healthy blood contains the essences of life and energy, while unhealthy blood might be anemic or even laden with disease. Within this duality of blood is great power—to infuse energy, health, and life, or to expunge it just as quickly.</p>\n<p>Some individuals are sensitive to the power within blood, and in time might even begin to control it. This practice is known by magical scholars as sanguimancy to distinguish it from a sorcerer's magical bloodline, though most people are ignorant of the distinction and use the same term—blood magic—for both.</p>\n<p>Sanguimancy is a strange and lonely path. Those who practice it are few in number, and when they do come into contact with others, people often react to them with caution, if not outright revulsion. Consequently, few actively seek out these bloody powers. Those with ties to blood, be it vampires and their associates, practitioners of bloody rites—such as worshippers of Camazotz—or even specialists in medicine can all find themselves drawn to sanguimancy.</p>\n<p>While its effects are undeniably magical, sanguimancy falls outside the established norms of spellcasting. Casters combine spells with sanguimancy to create powerful synergies, while warriors appreciate being able to wield their abilities even after their peers' spells have run dry. The most powerful sanguimancers can wield the energies contained within blood to shield themselves from harm, cause internal bleeding, and even unleash a barrage of razor-sharp needles of blood.</p>\n<p>Blood sensitivity is uncommon but found in diverse places. It's difficult to tell if someone is blood sensitive without them admitting to it or overtly manifesting their powers in public. As a result, estimates of how many members of a population are blood sensitive tend to be accurate only if sanguimancy is tolerated. Another tradition of blood magic, hemotheurgy, has many similarities to sanguimancy but carries a far different effect on its practitioners. The leech-covered bloatmages of Kaer Maga practice this self-destructive magic, overriding their bodies' fail-safes to produce more blood than their bodies need in order to enhance their magic.</p>\n<p>The precise manner in which blood sensitivity comes about remains poorly understood, even among the magical scholars who have rigorously studied its existence. Most agree that exposure to fresh blood is a key factor in manifesting the attunement. Some speculate that repeated exposure from a young age is necessary, while others surmise a single incident might be all that's required, provided that such an event occurs while in a state of extraordinarily heightened emotion. And, of course, some believe that blood sensitivity could be a divinely preordained gift (or curse), an affinity you're born with, or a simple matter of luck. As of yet, no one has been able to reliably induce a test subject with the power of sanguimancy, and most experiments attempting to do so are considered evil.</p>\n<h2>Blood Sensitivity</h2>\n<p>As a discovered affinity, blood sensitivity can manifest out of nowhere with no deliberate effort on your part.

If you're a cloistered cleric, you primarily cast spells. Most of your spells can boost, protect, or heal your allies. Depending on your deity, you get extra spells to heal your allies or harm your enemies.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You might make diplomatic overtures or deliver impressive speeches. Because you're wise, you also pick up on falsehoods others tell.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You detect nearby magic and interpret any religious writing you come across. You might also concentrate on a protective spell for your allies in case of attack. After a battle or hazard, you might heal anyone who was hurt.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You might perform services at a temple, travel to spread the word of your deity, research scripture, celebrate holy days, or even found a new temple.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit the temples and holy places sacred to your faith, and have an immediate affinity with other worshippers of your deity.</li>\n<li>Know the teachings of your religion's holy texts and how they apply to a dilemma.</li>\n<li>Cooperate with your allies, provided they don't ask you to go against divine will.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find your devotion impressive, even if they don't understand it.</li>\n<li>Expect you to heal their wounds.</li>\n<li>Rely on you to interact with other religious figures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.

The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face the choice of whether you'll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Key Attribute: CHARISMA</strong></p>\n<p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to Charisma.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Points: 6 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p>\n<p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p>\n<h1 class=\"title\">Roleplaying the Sorcerer</h1>\n<h2 class=\"title\">During Combat Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You use spells to injure your enemies, influence their minds, and hamper their movements.

If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell.

Some patrons are multifaceted, appearing in different guises, and granting different powers to different witches.

Whether you learned in the storied halls of a formal institution, via an apprenticeship with an archmage, or taught yourself from secondhand tomes, your arcane school indelibly set the curriculum and direction of your magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum Spells:</strong> You automatically add some of the spells listed in your school's curriculum to your spellbook. At 1st level, you add a cantrip and two 1st-rank spells of your choice. As soon as you gain the ability to cast wizard spells of a new rank, choose one of the spells from your curriculum of that rank to add to your spellbook. A superscript \"U\" indicates an uncommon spell. Your GM might allow you to swap or add other spells to your curriculum if they strongly fit the theme.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Slots:</strong> Each day, you can prepare an extra cantrip from your curriculum. You also gain an extra spell slot at each spell rank for which you have wizard spell slots. You can prepare only spells from your school's curriculum in these extra slots. Any spell listed in your curriculum of a suitable spell rank is eligible to be prepared in each of these extra slots, regardless of how you added the spell to your spellbook.</p>\n<p><strong>School Spells:</strong> School spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to study your spellbook or conduct arcane research.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but it can never be more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>You learn the initial school spell, which is unique to your school. You can learn the advanced school spell with the Advanced School Spell feat.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.wObrT6PytPdS5aUi]{School of Ars Grammatica}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.E4GZDMn4DYk6qSEV]{School of Battle Magic}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ZpFCZnVzIfZLfNii]{School of the Boundary}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.YZ2XPmx1WHyWtM0g]{School of Civic Wizardry}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.L5FiuXsfW6Sa31gO]{School of Mentalism}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ZBFICTkzUjE4BDGJ]{School of Protean Form}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.xYYhJtGhFSWNifcO]{School of Unified Magical Theory}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.srcPBNjhq7FBSmi3]{Red Mantis Magic School}</p>\n<p></p>"

The main area your choice will impact is in spellcasting items, such as scrolls and wands. Remove all potency runes, striking runes, and resilient runes. Items that normally grant an item bonus to statistics or damage dice no longer do, other than the base item bonus to AC from armor. Apex items do not increase attribute modifiers. If your world still includes magic items, a safe bet is to continue to give out consumable items. If you choose to eliminate runes entirely, this can reduce the PCs' damage since they won't have runes like flaming or holy. If you've removed nearly all treasure, challenges might become more difficult, even with automatic bonuses.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Pathfinder GM Core pg. 83</em></span></p>"

You might restrict the free feats to those of a single archetype each character in the group has (for a shared backstory), those of archetypes fitting a certain theme (such as only ones from magical archetypes in a game set in a magic school), or entirely unrestricted if you just want a higher-powered game.</p>\n<p>If the group all has the same archetype or draws from a limited list, you might want to ignore the free archetype's normal restriction of selecting a certain number of feats before taking a new archetype. That way a character can still pursue another archetype that also fits their character.</p>\n<h3>Playing with Free Archetypes</h3>\n<p>Free-archetype characters are a bit more versatile and powerful than normal, but usually not so much that they unbalance your game. However, due to the characters' increased access to archetype feats, you should place a limit on the number of feats that scale based on a character's number of archetype feats (mainly multiclass Resiliency feats).

These are collectively a single set of ability boosts, so a character can't boost the same ability score more than once per set; players can put a dot next to each boosted ability score or otherwise mark it to keep track. PCs also receive an ability boost at 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th level (a second set); at 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th level (a third set); and at 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th level (the fourth and final set).</p>\n<p>This spreads out the ability boosts, and using them earlier means a character can increase their most important ability modifiers at a lower level.

          "text": "<p>This variant removes a character's level from their proficiency bonus, scaling it differently for a style of game that's outside the norm. This is a significant change to the system. The proficiency rank progression in Player Core is designed for heroic fantasy games where heroes rise from humble origins to world-shattering strength. For some games, this narrative arc doesn't fit. Such games are about hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which even the world's best fighter can't guarantee a win against a large group of moderately skilled brigands.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation is fairly straightforward: the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. It's best to give an untrained character a –2 proficiency modifier instead of a +0 proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element. These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks, ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells.</p>\n<p>Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks. You can just subtract the level from the DC tables on page 53, or you can reference the Simple Skill DCs (No Level) table for a set of DCs that's easier to remember. The new DCs make it a little harder for high-level characters to succeed than it would be when using the default numbers, in keeping with the theme mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to flatten out, with critical successes and critical failures being less likely across the game. This is particularly notable in spells, where you're less likely to see the extreme effects of critical failures on saves.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\"><caption><strong>TABLE: SIMPLE SKILL DCS (NO LEVEL)</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Proficiency Rank</strong></th>\n<th><strong>DC</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Untrained</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trained</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expert</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legendary</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Adjusting Encounters</h3>\n<p>Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and conversely, where a single higher-level monster is not much of a threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in encounter building, including shifts in the PCs' rewards.</p>\n<p>Under the default math, two monsters of a certain level are roughly as challenging as a single monster 2 levels higher. However, with level removed from proficiency, this assumption is no longer true. The XP budget for creatures uses a different scale, as shown in the Creature XP (No Level) table. You'll still use the same XP budget for a given threat level as shown on the @UUID[.WZgFEMDSP9TvYc4u]{Encounter Budget} (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for a severe-threat encounter, and so on).</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\"><caption><strong>TABLE: CREATURE XP (NO LEVEL)</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p><strong>Creature's Level</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th><strong>XP</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 7</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 6</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 5</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 4</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 3</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 2</td>\n<td>26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 1</td>\n<td>32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 1</td>\n<td>48</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 2</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 3</td>\n<td>72</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 4</td>\n<td>90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 5</td>\n<td>108</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 6</td>\n<td>135</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 7</td>\n<td>160</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While the XP values in the Creature XP (No Level) table work well in most cases, sometimes they might not account for the effects of creatures' special abilities when facing a party of a drastically different level.

Too many encounters with higher-level foes can wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected, or vice versa if they're fighting weaker foes that put up more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can make periodic adjustments if the PCs' treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making it so they can't easily sell or buy magic items will mean it's harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep the issue entirely, you can use automatic bonus progression.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Pathfinder GM Core pg. 85</em></span></p>"

If your group wants to tell tales like those, you can use the stamina variant to help make that happen.</p>\n<h2>Stamina Points</h2>\n<p>Stamina Points represent a character's energy and readiness. They're reduced by damage just like Hit Points, but a character always loses their Stamina Points first, and loses Hit Points only if they're out of Stamina Points. If a character takes damage exceeding their remaining Stamina Points, the excess damage reduces their Hit Points. However, they lose any temporary Hit Points before losing Stamina Points.</p>\n<p>Though Stamina Points and Hit Points function similarly when a character takes damage, a character recovers them differently. A <em>heal</em> spell restores Hit Points, not Stamina Points, and the actions described below (like Take a Breather) restore only Stamina Points, not Hit Points. A character regains all their Stamina Points after a full night's rest. Hit Points still determine whether a character remains conscious—a character at 0 HP is unconscious, no matter how many Stamina Points they have. In addition to their ancestry Hit Points, a PC gains the number of Stamina Points and Hit Points indicated in the second and third columns of table above at 1st level. Both values increase by the same amount at each level thereafter. This replaces the Hit Points a character gains from their class in a standard game.</p>\n<h2>Resolve Points</h2>\n<p>In this variant, each PC also has a pool of Resolve Points, representing their intrinsic grit and luck. A character's maximum Resolve Points is equal to their key attribute modifier, and a character regains all their Resolve Points with a full night's rest. In addition to spending Resolve Points to regain Stamina Points (as described under Stamina Actions), characters can spend Resolve Points in the following way.</p>\n<h3>Stabilize</h3>\n<p>If a character is dying at the start of their turn, their player can spend 1 Resolve Point to stabilize at 0 HP, gaining or increasing the wounded condition as normal for stabilizing. At the start of the character's next turn, they gain 1 HP and wake up (unless they started dying again). The character can act on that turn. Consider this an optional rule best suited for groups that have little access to healing. When using this rule, you might remove the ability for characters to use Hero Points to stabilize.</p>\n<h2>Stamina Actions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qc0VsZ0UesnurUUB]{Take a Breather}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xJEkXFJgEfEida27]{Rally}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Stamina Feats</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.dUnT3HWMFD3d2eBJ]{Encouraging Words}</li>\n<li>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jFmdevE4nKevovzo]{Steel Your Resolve}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Creatures</h2>\n<p>There's no need to give Stamina Points to monsters that are expected to be encountered once and likely defeated. However, you might use Stamina Points for a recurring character, especially an NPC who fights alongside the PCs. Usually, it's easiest to turn half the creature's Hit Points into Stamina Points. While enemy healers still work as they're intended to, players might be upset about the enemies' ability to heal their allies to full Hit Points, while the PCs are left not being able to heal their allies' Stamina Points. In this case, give more enemies Stamina Points to compensate.</p>\n<h2>No-Limit Stamina</h2>\n<p>If you want a fast-paced, almost superheroic game, you can skip the Resolve Point component of this subsystem and simply make Taking a Breather and Rally free. This gives the characters a lot of staying power, meaning that the group will typically keep adventuring until they run out of spells for the day, rather than having the additional pressure of running out of Resolve Points. If you use this approach, omit the Steel Your Resolve feat, as it's too powerful if there's no cost to use it! Alternatively, if you want to keep it, you can require a character to Take a Breather before they can Steel their Resolve again.</p>\n<h2>Stamina's Impact</h2>\n<p>The main gameplay consequence of using these stamina rules is that a quick 10- or 20-minute rest can restore most groups to full or nearly full health via Taking a Breather and Treating Wounds as necessary, allowing more encounters with shorter breaks in between. Additionally, charismatic or otherwise diplomatic characters gain fun and useful ways to bolster their allies.</p>\n<p>Because spells that heal Hit Points don't restore Stamina Points, it's a little harder to heal up completely in the middle of a fight. This can mean that fights become deadly after characters have been beaten down, possibly causing retreats to be more frequent, but the retreats themselves are shorter. The focus of the game can stay consistently within encounters, with less managing of time and resources outside of battle.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Pathfinder GMG pg. 200</em></span></p>"

          "name": "Duels",
          "text": "<h1>Setting Up a Duel</h1>\n<p>Participants must willingly agree to the duel and to abide by its rules. If one of the duelists breaks the duel's rules (and, more importantly, is caught doing so), that duelist loses, taking any penalties agreed upon when the challenge was accepted. Here are some sample dueling rules.</p>\n<h2>Compete Alone</h2>\n<p>It's customary that each participant must compete alone and may receive no help from outside sources. However, some duels pit pairs of combatants against one another (either all together or as tag teams).</p>\n<h2>Compete Alone</h2>\n<p>The participants agree to the tools, including weapons and magic items, before the duel starts. Most combat duels that don't involve magic limit participants to melee weapons and prohibit the use of poison. Some duels forbid the use of polearms and other reach weapons. A spellcasting duel might agree upon a roughly equal number of magic items, and a cap on the power (in game terms, the level) of the items. Some spellcasting duels might prohibit certain types of spells, such as summoning or healing.</p>\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n<p>Combat duels typically last either until first blood (hitting and dealing damage) or until one of the duelists is knocked out. Most duels allow a participant to yield, which means they concede victory to their opponent, though sometimes this could diminish their social standing. Duels of talent usually involve several equal turns in which the duelists display their ability.</p>\n<h2>Adjudication</h2>\n<p>Most duels are overseen by a third party who ensures the duelists don't break the duel's rules—inadvertently or by cheating. Where duels are legal, this is typically a constable or magistrate. In other places, a cleric or other respected figure serves as judge. Typically the GM plays the judge.</p>\n<h1>Combat Duels</h1>\n<p>Unlike the other subsystems in this chapter, a combat duel works almost the same as a normal combat encounter, with a few exceptions. These rules require exceptional focus between two duelists and a third-party arbiter, and thus are not available in a normal combat.</p>\n<h2>Initiative and Dueling Actions</h2>\n<p>Unlike in typical combat, the duelists roll initiative checks at the beginning of each round of combat. Each round the combatant can choose to use Deception, Intimidation, or Perception when they roll initiative. Because a duelist might act twice in a row, durations that last until the beginning of a duelist's next turn might function oddly. A duelist acting second can choose to avoid such abilities that turn, or can choose to act second if they win initiative on the next round.</p>\n<p>If the duelist is at least trained in whichever initiative choice they pick, they gain the corresponding dueling reaction that round: Bullying Press for Intimidation, Deceptive Sidestep for Deception, or Sense Weakness for Perception. Neither duelist is aware of what type of roll the other used for initiative—surprise and the use of dueling actions are a part of dueling strategies. Familiars and companions, even when allowed in the duel, can't use these actions, nor can bystanders.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.TXqTIwNGULs3j6CH]{Bullying Press}</h3>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.TXqTIwNGULs3j6CH inline]</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1LDOfV8jEka09eXr]{Deceptive Sidestep}</h3>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1LDOfV8jEka09eXr inline]</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.uWTQxEOj2pl45Kns]{Sense Weakness}</h3>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.uWTQxEOj2pl45Kns inline]</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ending the Duel</h2>\n<p>The duel ends when the duel's judge confirms the victory condition, when the judge determines one of the duelists has cheated, or when one of the duelists yields. Note that if either of the combatants attempts to continue the duel after its end, the combatants should roll initiative and proceed with normal combat.</p>\n<h1>Spellcasting Duels</h1>\n<p>Like combat duels, spellcasting duels take place in encounter mode, but their rules are not available during normal combat. They are typically more organized affairs than combat duels. Many spellcasting duels prohibit any sort of combat but spellcasting. They typically have the duelists take turns casting a turn's worth of spells, giving their rivals a chance to counter the spells if they can.</p>\n<h2>Initiative and Dueling Actions</h2>\n<p>In most cases, each duelist rolls initiative normally and proceeds in that initiative order throughout the duel, unlike in a combat duel. Each duelist can roll an Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion check instead of Perception. If they are trained at that skill, they gain the tradition focus of that skill, which allows them to hone in on a magical tradition corresponding to the check they made for their initiative roll. They also gain the Dueling Counter reaction, which enables a duelist to counter their opponent's spell if their tradition focus matches the tradition of that spell. They also gain the Change Tradition Focus action, which changes the duelist's tradition focus to a different tradition. Familiars and companions, even when allowed in the duel, can't use these actions, nor can bystanders.</p>\n<p>When mixing a spellcasting duel and a combat duel, use the initiative rules for combat dueling, but allow the duelist to roll Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion for their initiative checks. They still gain the Dueling Counter reaction and Change Tradition Focus action, though Change Tradition Focus is less useful in combat duels.</p>\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xGqOIheAOV12RGU4]{Dueling Counter}</h3>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xGqOIheAOV12RGU4 inline]</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.s4s40hJr5uRLOqix]{Change Tradition Focus}</h3>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.s4s40hJr5uRLOqix inline]</p>\n<h2>Ending the Duel</h2>\n<p>Just like a combat duel, a spellcasting duel ends when the duel's judge confirms the victory condition, when the judge determines one of the duelists has cheated, or when one of the duelists yields.

For a typical rate of growth, give the PCs enough followers for the organization to level up at roughly the same rate as the PCs. In some cases, you might want to vary that rate—sometimes drastically. Perhaps the 10th-level PCs have a 20th-level organization with top lieutenants nearly as powerful as the PCs, or maybe the PCs start gathering followers only at 15th level and start their organization from scratch as a 1st-level organization.</p>\n<h3>Leadership Events</h3>\n<p>During downtime, or over the course of long stretches of time when the PCs aren't in downtime but their organization is operating in the background, you should periodically provide special leadership events. These are in addition to the events you would normally provide the PCs during downtime. These should generally be a good mix between the following three categories.</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>: An opportunity offers the PCs a chance to make a consequential decision that shapes the organization moving forward. For instance, the Aspis Consortium offers the PCs a deal to store their goods in the PCs' mercenary fort. Accepting gives the PCs money, but they'll have to deal with the consortium's unsavory goods. Rejecting the proposal might upset the consortium, but it allows the PCs to show their priorities between conscience and coin.</p>\n<p><strong>Trouble:</strong> Something's gone wrong with the organization. Perhaps the thieves' guild is dealing with a clever new guard captain and needs help from the PCs to stay safe. Typically the resources the PCs need to invest to solve the troubles should be less than the benefits the PCs gain from windfalls to ensure that the organization is providing a substantial benefit to the PCs, rather than simply evening out.</p>\n<p><strong>Windfall:</strong> The organization has received an unexpected benefit that helps the PCs. This is typically access to an uncommon option: perhaps the organization researched a new spell or discovered the techniques for an uncommon feat. However, it could be extra money or resources, clues for the PCs' adventures, political prestige, or anything else you can think of. The players might even be able to suggest a few options for their followers and lieutenants to work toward to give you some ideas.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Pathfinder GM Core pg. 204-205</em></span></p>"

Every character gains a mythic Calling when they first gain mythic power, which influences some of the fundamental nature of their power. They also gain mythic feats and, ultimately, a mythic destiny. </p>\n<p>The following sections explain how becoming mythic affects a PC.</p>\n<h2>Mythic Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Mythic characters have access to abilities that allow them to roll various checks using mythic proficiency instead of their normal proficiency. These abilities typically involve drawing on your reserves of mythic power to perform superhuman exploits that would be beyond normal mortal capabilities. Your proficiency bonus when using mythic proficiency is 10 plus your level. Mythic proficiency is the step above legendary proficiency, so a character attempting a check at mythic proficiency can complete any task that normally requires a specific proficiency, even if they wouldn't normally meet that requirement (such as disabling a hazard that normally requires expert or greater proficiency.)</p>\n<p>Unlike trained, expert, master, and legendary proficiency, you use mythic proficiency only when an ability tells you to, and these abilities typically require you to expend a Mythic Point to gain their benefits.</p>\n<h2>Mythic Points</h2>\n<p>The mythic power instilled in you gives you a pool of Mythic Points. Unlike most aspects of your character, which persist over the long term, Mythic Points last for only a single session. Mythic Points are required to cast mythic spells, use some mythic feats, activate mythic items, and can be required to attempt some mythic deeds (see below).</p>\n<p>Each mythic character starts the session with 3 Mythic Points and can have a maximum of 3 Mythic Points at any time. If you have Mythic Points, you do <em>not</em> gain Hero Points.</p>\n<h3>Mythic Deeds</h3>\n<p>A mythic deed is a task, often in the form of a hazard or noncombat challenge, that restores an adventuring party's Mythic Points once successfully navigated. It's even possible that a party might uncover their Callings after completing their first mythic deed as non-mythic characters. A mythic deed should generally be at least a moderate challenge for a party of the characters' level or involve a combination of hard and very hard skill checks for the @UUID[.pBS3DUjlzVuFgapv]{PCs' level}; if the deed is easily accomplished without using mythic resources, it isn't a mythic deed.</p>\n<p>Many mythic monsters have mythic deeds associated with them. These can serve as examples for creating your own mythic deeds as a GM and are often intended to allow players to interact with the monster at a level where fighting the creature would be unwise or unrewarding.</p>\n<p>A mythic deed tied to a monster doesn't necessarily need to be presented at a different level than the monster it's associated with. For mythic monsters whose presence in a campaign is only intended to last a single session, it's likely that any associated mythic deeds will be no more than 2 levels higher than the monster and no more than 2 levels lower.</p>\n<h3>Recovering Mythic Points</h3>\n<p>Mythic power is a rare and precious resource. While it accrues and recovers naturally within mythic characters over time, it can be difficult to accrue during the heat of combat. The following are ways a character might regain Mythic Points during a session.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Slaying a mythic opponent</strong> in combat restores 2 Mythic Points to the character whose attack, spell, or effect defeated the opponent, and 1 Mythic Point to all other mythic characters in the party.</li>\n<li><strong>Completing a mythic deed</strong> restores 3 Mythic Points to each mythic character in the party.</li>\n<li>Following their Calling by taking actions particularly in line with the edicts (as determined by the GM) restores 1 Mythic Point to that character's mythic pool.</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>A legendary accomplishment</strong> or epic sacrifice can restore 1 or more Mythic Points for a character, even if it's not one of the more defined ways to recover Mythic Points. The GM gauges when this should occur. Mythic characters have more power over their own story than most and should be rewarded when the story is particularly compelling!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Death and Dying as a Mythic Character</h2>\n<p>Mythic characters are much harder to kill than normal heroes. When a mythic character's dying value would reach an amount sufficient to kill them (usually 4), they instead increase their doomed value by 1 and stabilize at 0 Hit Points. A mythic character doesn't permanently die until their doomed value reaches 4. As normal, a mythic character's doomed value decreases by 1 each time they get a full night's rest.</p>\n<p></p>"

        "Special Battles": {
          "name": "Special Battles",
          "text": "<h2>Mounted Combat</h2>\n<p>You can ride some creatures into combat. As noted in the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Mount} specialty basic action, your mount needs to be willing and at least one size larger than you. Your mount acts on your initiative. You must use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} action to get your mount to spend its actions. If you don't, the animal wastes its actions. If you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Rq5wkA8DtsmbzoGV]{Ride} general feat, you succeed automatically when you Command an Animal that's your mount.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are mounted on a horse and you make three attacks, your horse would remain stationary since you didn't command it. If you instead spent your first action to Command an Animal and succeeded, you could get your mount to Stride. You could spend your next action to attack or to command the horse to attack, but not both.</p>\n<h3>Mounted Attacks</h3>\n<p>You and your mount fight as a unit. Consequently, you share a multiple attack penalty. For example, if you Strike and then Command an Animal to have your mount Strike, your mount's attack takes a –5 multiple attack penalty. You occupy every square of your mount's space for the purpose of making attacks. If you were a Medium creature on a Large mount, you could attack a creature on one side of your mount, then attack on the opposite side. On a Medium or smaller mount, use the normal reach of an attack. On a Large or Huge mount, you can attack any square adjacent to the mount if you have 5- or 10-foot reach, or any square within 10 feet of the mount (including diagonally) if you have 15-foot reach. Use the adjusted reach for determining flanking and other rules that depend on reach.</p>\n<h3>Mounted Defenses</h3>\n<p>Attackers can target either you or your mount. An area effect affects both of you as long as you're both in the area. You are in an attacker's reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you're mounted if the mount would be in the way (as determined by the GM). Because you can't move your body as freely while you're riding a mount, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.Item.9c93NfZpENofiGUp]{Effect: Mounted}</p>\n<h2>Aerial Combat</h2>\n<p>Many monsters can fly, and PCs can use spells and items to gain the ability to fly. Flying creatures have to use the Fly action to move through the air. Performing an especially tricky maneuver might require using Acrobatics to Maneuver in Flight. Creatures might fall from the sky, using the falling rules found on page 421. At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work in the air. For instance, a flying creature couldn't @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}.</p>\n<h2>Aquatic Combat</h2>\n<p>Use these rules for battles in water or underwater:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} unless you have a swim Speed.</li>\n<li>You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.</li>\n<li>You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your attack roll for bludgeoning or slashing attacks that pass through water.</li>\n<li>Ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.</li>\n<li>You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater. As normal for how traits work, any part of the effect that's unrelated to fire still works. For example, an attack with a flaming battleaxe could still deal its physical damage, just not its fire damage.</li>\n<li>At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.Item.TPbr1kErAAJKBi3V]{Effect: Aquatic Combat}</p>\n<h3>Drowning and Suffocating</h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including Casting a Spell) you lose all remaining air.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.other-effects.Item.2u26bmArDPuoCljc]{Effect: Remaining Air}</p>\n<p>When you run out of air, you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 @Check[fortitude] save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take @Damage[1d10[untyped]] damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).</p>\n<p><em>Section: Playing the Game</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Pathfinder Player Core pg. 437</em></span></p>"

Alignment that had been set before on actors is still in actor data in the form of inert traits. These traits are not displayed on the sheet until a module adds the traits back. The PF2e Legacy Data module does this, and smaller modules can easily do this. You can also do this without a module by simply registering the four alignment traits in the system homebrew settings menu as actor traits.</p>\n<p>Evil fiends and good celestials have had the unholy or holy trait added to them. NPC strikes that dealt evil or good damage have been converted to deal spirit damage with the unholy or holy trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Removal of Spell Schools</strong> Seven of the eight spell schools have been removed: Abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, necromancy, and transmutation have been removed from spells, feats, equipment, and the like. Illusion is still a trait used in the remaster rules and has been kept.</p>\n<p><strong>Removal of Spell Components</strong> Spell components (verbal, somatic, material) have been removed from all spells. If a spell had a verbal component it gained the concentrate trait. If the spell had a somatic component it gained the manipulate trait. As a general rule, all spells now require speaking. This general rule is modified by the new 'subtle' trait.</p>\n<h2>Domains</h2>\n<p>Some domains have been renamed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Delirium is now Disorientation.</span></li>\n<li><span>Void is now Nothingness.</span></li>\n<li><span>Wyrmkin is now Dragon.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Languages</h2>\n<p>Several languages have been renamed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Abyssal is now Chthonian.</span></li>\n<li><span>Aquan is now Thalassic.</span></li>\n<li><span>Auran is now Sussuran.</span></li>\n<li><span>Celestial is now Empyrean.</span></li>\n<li><span>Druidic is now Wildsong.</span></li>\n<li><span>Gnoll is now Kholo.</span></li>\n<li><span>Grippli is now Tripkee.</span></li>\n<li><span>Ignan is now Pyric.</span></li>\n<li><span>Infernal is now Diabolic.</span></li>\n<li><span>Sylvan is now Fey.</span></li>\n<li><span>Terran is now Petran.</span></li>\n<li><span>Undercommon is now Sakvroth.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pantheons</h2>\n<p>The following deity pantheons have been renamed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dwarven Pantheon is now Stone's Blood.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Elven Pantheon is now Sovyrian Conclave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Followers of Fate is now Norns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Prismatic Ray is now Radiant Prism.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"
