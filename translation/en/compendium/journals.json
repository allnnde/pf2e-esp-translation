          "text": "<p>Androids thrive in nearly any environment and exist as part of countless cultures, meaning they can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy. Many androids are curious about their origins, traveling alone or with others in search of answers to a variety of metaphysical and material questions about their identities and the greater cosmos. Androids are diverse, with few individuals sharing the exact same appearance, despite their manufactured state.</p>\n<p>If you want to roleplay a synthetic character on a journey of self-discovery, you should play an android.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to avoid others taking advantage of you.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the wider galaxy.</li>\n<li>Judge others based on how they treat service workers, blue-collar laborers, fans, or pets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have trouble parsing your emotions or understanding when you express them.</li>\n<li>Secretly covet your lack of aging.</li>\n<li>Have some level of guilt for their ancestors' use of your species as laborers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Androids are biomechanical constructs who typically resemble humanoids with glowing circuitry. Most were created in specialized birthing sites called foundries. Older variants of androids, such as androids on Golarion, were primarily biological, but androids in the modern era usually incorporate more technological components and synthetic elements into their bodies. Androids need to eat and sleep, but they don't reproduce, don't age, and have no innate concept of gender—though many express humanoid gender identities or shift fluidly between them. Most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so, allowing new souls to inhabit them in a process called renewal.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Androids tend to be cautious when visiting new places and meeting new people. Once comfortable, androids can form tight bonds of friendship and kinship, adopting found families, and choosing entire neighborhoods and communities as their home, rather than remaining confined by the boundaries formed by walls. Androids often go out of their way to help one another and their chosen families and communities, and most hesitate to destroy the body of another android, knowing that to do so ends not only one life, but erases the countless other souls who could one day inhabit that body.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Asha, Blue-17, Celita, Daniv, Emene-3, Era- 4, Flick, Garro, Historia-6, Hope-1, Iseph, Melody, Naga, Olas, Omen, Prime, Ruby-17, Stringer, Twenty Six, Urdun, Verity-3, Yose</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Androids hold a variety of religious and philosophical views, with individuals sometimes collecting beliefs and practices through decades of lived experiences. With a similar perspective to elves and other long-lived species, androids tend to view reality differently than beings with shorter lifespans. Many androids are patient in achieving their goals and might create plans that span decades or centuries, hoping they will be alive to experience the results. Elder androids who voluntarily pass on to the next part of their cycle sometimes bequeath their goals to the next soul to inhabit their body.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>discover your origins, help others achieve long-term goals, plan for the future</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>engage in reckless or self-destructive behavior</p>\n<h2>Android Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Barathus are floating, aberrant beings who effortlessly edit their own genetic code and merge together into countless bizarre and beautiful configurations. Early-stage barathus tend to be individualistic and gravitate toward learning about other cultures, while more experienced barathus develop a fluid sense of self and seek communion with others on a deeper level. Dreamers retreat to a transcendent reality only they can experience</p>\n<p>If you want a character with an alien mindset who adapts to any situation, you should play a barathu.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy new experiences and eagerly adapt to new ideas.</li>\n<li>Evolve your body frequently based on the environment or situation.</li>\n<li>Merge with your companions or copy their genetic structure to learn about them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intrigued by your unique anatomy.</li>\n<li>Admire your adaptability.</li>\n<li>Struggle to recognize you because of your frequently changing appearance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The average barathu has a floating, blimp-like body with colorful tentacles and limbs dangling from it. Their bodies reflect their personal vision of themselves, and they maintain some control of its presentation. Since barathus frequently change their bodies at a genetic level, a barathu might experience dozens of unique evolutions over the course of their lifetime. Barathus mold themselves into larger, more fantastical forms after merging. Barathu conglomerates might appear as gigantic jellyfish, blooming ooze-flowers, or a flock of rainbow cloud rays.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most barathus have a fluid sense of self. In their early stage, young barathus often take inspiration from other cultures and exhibit more individualistic tendencies, then temper this worldview as they gain experience and merge with others. A barathu can merge with other barathus into a compound being called a conglomerate. A barathu conglomerate is greater than the sum of its parts, with an entirely new identity and worldview created by the fusion. Barathu conglomerates who split back into their individual parts recall only hazy memories from their time within the conglomerate, described by some as watching a holovid reel. While young barathus tend to find the experience disconcerting, most older barathus spend time with conglomerates. As their bodies and memories begin to fade with age, many barathus choose to merge permanently with a conglomerate, letting go of their individual self to join a greater consciousness and being.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Barathu names change when they merge and split back into their component parts. Many early stage barathus choose their own names, selecting words for concepts that resonate with them or creating combinations of sounds they find pleasing. Some barathu names include Ataraxia, Breeze, Bubble in Flight, Dololola, Gleelee, Harmony of Many, Ixeelu, Lilting Song, Sigh, Tenfold Storm, Unity of Purpose, Vortex, Wonder Among Iridescent Clouds, Xonswe, and Y.</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Many barathus identify with Oras and choose to explore his faith, seeing their own constant evolution as a mirror of his journey from cell to god. Barathus who explored Liavara and experienced its cosmic song have their own beliefs, which they share in songs unfathomable to everyone except other Dreamers. A barathu's worldview and religion shift throughout their lifetime as they merge with others and literally expand their mind.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>adapt to new situations, change your body into the shape you choose, work together to solve problems</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>tackle problems on your own</p>\n<h2>Barathu Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 5 Feet (Hover); Fly 20 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Brethedan, Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence, modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Human ambition has created empires throughout the stars. The Pact Worlds have many human residents, while the expansion of the Azlanti Star Empire presents a more sinister expression of humanity's growth. Though the Azlanti Star Empire is considered a bastion of oppression, there are countless diverse and inclusive societies established by humanity across the galaxy. Humans played a role in founding the most famous port in the known cosmos: Absalom Station. Regardless of their motives, humans thrive in both urban sprawls and in the most remote galactic frontiers.</p>\n<p>If you want an adaptable character who can become just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either for personal gain or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Yearn to explore and experience the cosmos.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility and usual open-mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your motivations, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics vary based on their lineage and home world. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Some environments produce distinct human appearances, such as crimson-skinned hylki humans living on Akiton. Many humans enjoy altering their appearances by dyeing their hair, tattooing or scarring their skin, adorning themselves with body art and decorative garments, and installing augmentations.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human societies are as varied as the worlds they thrive on. While the Azlanti Star Empire seeks to recapture an imagined era of glory by isolating and idealizing an ancient culture from lost Golarion, most human groups coexist with other species in diverse communities. Human settlements just a few miles apart might have wildly different governmental styles and social norms. Despite their diverse lifestyles and outlooks, humans are adaptive and ambitious traits that have driven them to explore the unknown, forge their own futures, and settle on countless planets, creating lives for themselves by either integrating into alien societies or creating communities and settlements on distant worlds.</p>\n<p>Of all the common ancestries in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion's disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While Absalom Station and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Akif, Alezandaru, Amare, Baolo, Belor, Darilian, Hadzi, Hai Minh, Hiriko, Iolana, Jokug, Korva, Morvius, Navasi, Pao, Pasara, Raziya, Revhi, Sahba, Seoni, Sephia, Signe, Valeros, Valki, Yon, Zemir</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Humans often believe in the structures they've established, and many adhere to the ideals of the Pact or follow the laws of other regions or organizations, like the Azlanti Star Empire or the Free Captains. Many also cleave tightly to faith, philosophy, or religion, finding in these intellectual and spiritual touchstones confidence, clarity, and comfort. Since humanity eagerly embraces change, there are always humans who oppose societal norms by challenging long-standing beliefs or laws. These ideals, whether societal, intellectual, or spiritual, are often used as a driving force or justification for a human's behavior and ambitions.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>devote yourself to a greater cause, explore the cosmos, strive for greatness</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>waste what little time you have</p>\n<h2>Human Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Two free attribute, boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Kasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, kasatha leaders realized their planet was dying and made a plan to leave Kasath and settle on the distant red world in the Pact System known as Akiton. Centuries later, they arrived aboard the worldship Idari to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay on board the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge are welcomed additions to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughout the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek to maintain balance and harmony between yourself and others, as well as among cosmic forces.</li>\n<li>Find traditional weaponry to be more honorable than modern munitions.</li>\n<li>Keep your mouth hidden with a scarf or mask while in public.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume your respect for tradition gives you an inflexible view of the universe.</li>\n<li>Go to you for advice and expect you to provide guidance and wisdom.</li>\n<li>Take your prioritization of personal dignity as a sign of elitism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kasathas are humanoids with gray skin, four arms, and pure black eyes.

After evolving to survive migrations on a massive world, many kasathas have wiry bodies with thick musculature that makes them strong despite their lanky appearance.</p>\n<p>Many kasathas prefer wearing baggy, layered clothing that conceals their multiple arms and what they're wielding.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Kasathan culture prioritizes stability and balance, with a respect for honor, tradition, and the importance of upholding and respecting one's edicts and anathemas. Most kasathas form matriarchal and nomadic clans and subclans organized into a complex myriad of Great Families. While each Great Family has its own set of customs and traditions, common staples include concealing one's mouth from all but your most intimate companions, a belief in the honor of fighting with melee weapons, and a coming-of-age period known as the Tempering, a traditionally yearlong period that could last longer for some kasathas. During their Tempering, a kasatha is encouraged to test their limits, learn from different cultures, and forgo familial customs in the hopes of learning firsthand the importance of stability and tradition.</p>\n<p>While most kasathas go by their first name, many have a full name consisting of up to half a dozen elements referring to one's ancestors, clan, and connection to the Great Families of Kasath. For example, a kasatha properly named Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan Allar and House Holdare, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts would likely introduce themself as Barasul.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Altronus, Barasul, Ehu, Esar, Gorsen, Hadif, Jahir, Kala, Khsutil, Maeda, Metweska, Ninura, Remu, Senesel, Tolar, Umana, Voloteo, Zye</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Kasathan cultures hold custom and ancestral tradition in high regard, but each kasatha follows their own unique set of traditions, combining the rituals of their clan with those they develop through life experience.

They have a well-earned reputation for being charismatic, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one's strengths, surpass one's past successes, and strive for ever- greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training as well as to explore new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who strives for self- improvement and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Constantly strive to improve yourself through practicing skills and honing your powers.</li>\n<li>Prioritize learning and diplomacy if you're a damaya, or physique and tactical prowess if you're a korasha—or if you're an unbound lashunta, you have different priorities.</li>\n<li>Hold yourself to a much higher standard than you apply to others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think you're a perfectionist and find your pursuit of self-improvement tiresome.</li>\n<li>Distrust your psychic abilities, fearing you'll read their minds.</li>\n<li>Idealize or label you based on your genetic expression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Damayas tend to be tall and graceful with delicate features and are traditionally pushed toward artistic or intellectual pursuits and political occupations. Korashas are shorter, more muscular, and gravitate toward military service, manual labor, and wartime leadership. Regardless of heritage, all lashuntas have short forehead antennae that focus their telepathy, with colorful bumps and facial markings unique to each individual. Lashuntas produce pheromones that subtly broadcast their moods in ways that other ancestries might find alluring or unnerving.</p>\n<p>Around puberty, lashuntas traditionally choose whether to express damaya or korasha genetics—a decision that determines their physical development and influences their potential societal roles. Lashuntas achieve their choice through a combination of psychic rituals and gene therapy. Today, many young lashuntas have chosen to tread their own path and abstain from this choice, instead becoming “unbound.” Unbound lashuntas defy traditional roles and labels, and they might express traits and innate proclivities common to both of or neither of these groups. A growing minority of lashuntas instead pushes for further genetic diversification and aims to express unique or long-buried genetic permutations, pioneering entirely new chosen heritages. Whether such experimentation will prove fruitful remains to be seen.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Since time immemorial, lashuntas have dwelled in sprawling, picturesque cities along the shores and wildlands of Castrovel, a lush jungle world teeming with dangerous predators and extreme weather. These independent settlements are protected by a mighty military caste of psychic warriors, technological defenses, and magical countermeasures. The most iconic of these soldiers are the shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with (and take their name from)</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Lashunta naming conventions often use tonal elements.

Religious lashuntas tend to identify with faiths that encourage balance, knowledge, meditative practice, and seeking enlightenment, such as Eloritu, Ibra, or Yaraesa.

          "text": "<p>Pahtras evolved on a low-gravity jungle world called Pulonis, where they fought a long war for independence from their Veskarium conquerors. Recently, pahtra freedom fighters defeated the last Veskarium occupiers, then voted to join the Pact Worlds as a sovereign planet. Today, Pulonis is a lush, verdant world wracked by dangerous magnetic storms and scarred by the Veskarium's brutal invasion. The struggles of survival have influenced many pahtra traditions, leading to a culture of competitive war games, time-honored mysticism, and unorthodox technology. Music accompanies everything in pahtra culture, from popular entertainment to traditional battle tactics, with martial combat even categorized as a form of battle dance.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who fights for freedom with grace and style, you should play a pahtra.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy friendly competition.</li>\n<li>Be a talented performer or cultured aficionado of a wide variety of music and dance genres.</li>\n<li>Hold true to your ancestral traditions and refuse to kneel to cruel despots.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think you struggle with computers, vehicles, and other technology.</li>\n<li>Envy your musical talent.</li>\n<li>Assume you're looking for an excuse to prove yourself in a fight.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Pahtras are feline humanoids covered in fur. Their coats vary from black, white, blue, calico, bi-colored, and tabby, often possessing unique patterns of irregular shapes that seers traditionally use to divine an individual's potential. Their eyes vary across all colors of the visible spectrum. Typical pahtras stand between 6 and 7 feet tall, with elongated limbs and flexible joints. Their physiology is highly mutable, and families that leave Pulonis often find their children developing stockier and more muscular bodies as they adjust to higher gravity.</p>\n<p>Pahtras have sharp teeth and retractable claws on their hands and feet. They have a unique set of sensory organs across their muzzles, with functions varying from individual to individual. The most common of these peripheral nerves include harmonic sensory apparatuses that can feel sound.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Pahtra cultures are steeped in tradition and highly competitive, with individuals vying for recognition and resources in a struggle that mimics the harsh natural order of their planet. Before the Veskarium invasion, technological advancement on Pulonis stalled because of the world's unpredictable magnetic storms. Even today, Pulonian technological development focuses on ceramics, bioengineering, chemistry, and magic. After breaking from the Veskarium, residents of Pulonis's nation-states overwhelmingly voted to join the Pact Worlds, and they're still acclimating to this new political allegiance.</p>\n<p>The majority of pahtras are asexual. Most seek loving and life-long relationships with partners, but in modern times few commit to having children. Pahtras bear litters of six to eight children and prefer communal child-rearing, which allows parents to retain their individuality and shoulder responsibilities together.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Traditional pahtra names contain auspicious elements determined by a mystic.

Pulonian culture values personal success and standing out from one's peers and views all existence as a great song, with each person, event, and action adding to the galactic symphony that began at the dawn of time. Most pahtras enjoy healthy and productive competition, believing that one's true potential can emerge only from struggle. Underhandedly sabotaging or blatantly disrespecting a rival who follows the rules of a competition is a grave offense and usually seen as a sign of weakness. Pahtras make an exception to this code when facing a dishonorable foe, such as invaders from the technologically advanced Veskarium.

          "name": "Shirren",
          "text": "<p>Shirrens were originally members of the Swarm, a collection of colonies controlled by a hive mind that devoured entire planets. In time, shirrens gained a sense of individual self and rejected the Swarm's mindless consumption. They fled the hive mind and settled in the Pact Worlds, where they established their own communities and integrated into existing settlements.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who enjoys working as part of a team while still valuing independence, you should play a shirren.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Build deep and powerful bonds with your comrades.</li>\n<li>Enjoy your freedom and delight in the opportunity to make your own decisions.</li>\n<li>Dislike violence and prefer seeking peaceful compromises that benefit everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Count on you to mediate disputes and act as a voice of reason.</li>\n<li>Believe you overvalue and overthink simple choices.</li>\n<li>Are disconcerted by your insectile physiology and telepathy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Shirrens are arthropods with antennae, compound eyes, and chitinous exoskeletons. Shirrens walk upright and have three sets of limbs with three-clawed hands. The lower, weaker pairs of limbs are generally kept concealed and only used for ceremonial and reproductive reasons. Shirrens vary in appearance based on the colony they descended from, and some have vestigial wings, segmented thoraxes, or stingers.</p>\n<p>Shirrens have three sexes with roles in reproduction: male, female, and host. Female and male shirrens provide eggs and sperm respectively, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs. In some shirren communities, a single host incubates for many partners, while three-party unions are common in others. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a wormlike larval form. A parent might carry their larval child in a protective container to let them safely experience the world until they reach the pupal stage. Pupae undergo a second metamorphosis around eight years old before settling into their mature form a few years later.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Shirrens value individual choice and rights, having escaped from the Swarm thanks to an adaptation to their physiology that causes pleasure when they make choices for themselves. Shirren culture is built around this love of choice, encouraging shirrens to adapt themselves to a wide variety of beliefs, philosophies, and professions. Shirrens are highly communal and tend to feel lonely unless they're part of a group. Once a shirren chooses a community for themself, they often settle into a specialized role. When times are tough, they pitch in for teamwork and prioritize what's best for the group over what only benefits them as individuals, as long as they retain their autonomy.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Shirrens rely primarily on telepathy for communication and have a secret soul-name that's purely thought-based. Shirrens readily accept nicknames bestowed by their companions. Some shirren speech-names include Cesca, Chk Chk, Halicon, Izenzi, Jchk, J'scib, Keskodai, Kinnik, Korskal, Philt, Schect, Thast, T'sen, Xylit, Zenka, and Zigvigix.</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Shirrens define themselves by their choices and bristle against all forms of oppression. They enjoy cultural exchange, and while most eagerly adopt the deities and practices of other communities, others hold passionately atheistic worldviews that reject divine worship in favor of centering secular mortal experiences. Many shirren communities pay homage to Hylax, a benevolent deity believed to be the progenitor of their species. Hylax's faith is in turn shaped by her shirren followers, who believe her to be the pinnacle of unity without conformity.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>make your own choices, try to solve problems peacefully, work for the greater good of the group</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>inflict thoughtless destruction, take away another's right to make choices</p>\n<h2>Shirren Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Shirren, One regional language of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "name": "Skittermander",
          "text": "<p>Skittermanders are the original inhabitants of Oeddertchonk, a planet that the Veskarium invaded long before the Gap and is more commonly known today as Vesk-3. Colorful in both appearance and personality, skittermanders are generally energetic and altruistic.</p>\n<p>Most skittermanders quickly form new friendships, typically enjoy staying busy, and seek collaboration. Skittermanders are traditionally raised to always lend “allsix” hands to help a friend or stranger. Because of these values, they have a reputation throughout the galaxy for their compassion and selflessness that not every skittermander lives up to. Even the most altruistic skittermanders might be curious and nosy or insert themselves into others' business and problems as though they belong there.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who's friendly and emotional and who enjoys helping others, you should play a skittermander.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Love to help others, perhaps even prioritizing their needs over your own or feeling anxiety when you can't offer assistance.</li>\n<li>Enjoy exploring new places and meeting nufriends.</li>\n<li>Wear your heart on allsix of your sleeves.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are in awe of your boundless energy, enthusiasm, and positivity (or another emotion you express most often).</li>\n<li>Expect you to want to help them and act surprised if you don't.</li>\n<li>Assume you're flighty or unreliable and that you don't take yourself seriously.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Skittermanders are short and rotund, with big eyes and wide mouths lined with sharp teeth. They have six arms, leading to their use of the slang term allsix for giving one's best effort. A skittermander's body is covered in colorful fur, most commonly in bright shades of blue, green, purple, or red. Skittermanders are mammals who begin life in a non-sapient larval stage called a whelp. Skitterwhelps look like miniature skittermanders, save that they scrabble around on all eight limbs, have bigger ears, and have a secondary, tubelike mouth that sprouts from their abdomen. Skitterwhelps don't do much more than eat after birth, devouring fruits, seeds, leaves, raw meat, and any other source of nutrients they can cram into their mouths, hopefully with parental guidance. A skitterwhelp's stomach-mouth can attach to large prey and secretes numbing saliva, enabling them to cling to large animals and feed on them over time like a furry leech. Skitterwhelps mature into skittermanders around the age of six, when their stomach-mouths detach. Most retain their large and undiscerning appetite throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Skittermander societies don't create governments, laws, or rules, yet residents naturally help each other, forming free- form independent communities or joining neighboring societies. Communities are tight-knit and welcoming, and individuals tend to be friendly, sociable, and engaged. Skittermanders are often talkative, only abstaining from constant group conversation while focused on a particularly challenging task or while sleeping. Upon encountering a focused, silent skittermander, other skittermanders often fall silent in turn to help them concentrate, respectful of the hush that's overtaken their fellow.</p>\n<p>It's said that the Veskarium effortlessly conquered the skittermander home world of Oeddertchonk. When the skittermander residents realized their vesk visitors wanted to occupy their world, they “helped” by simply being elsewhere. Oeddertchonk is simultaneously an occupied outpost of the Veskarium and made up of entirely independent sovereign communities. The skittermanders help the Veskarium when they feel like it but don't acknowledge Veskarium leadership or governance. Because skittermanders don't engage in military resistance, the Veskarium happily tolerates the arrangement.</p>\n<p>A skittermander adds to their name as they age and pass certain milestones. A name begins very short, usually no more than one syllable. New syllables are added with the passing of time or whenever the skittermander feels like commemorating an important event. Added syllables are often repetitive, and many skittermanders adopt parts of other foreign names (notably Vesk) into their own.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ayoka, Baazo, Bixby, Dakoyo, Fipzul, Gazigaz, Jomp, Kayoko, Kimikim, Mimzy, Nako, Prismacora, Quonx, Rudfuz, Sprax, Timinim, Tipps, Tonkona, Viverivim</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Skittermanders care little for organized religion, instead passing on their beliefs and values through stories, songs, and art.

          "text": "<p>Vesk have a long history of conflict, first as conquerors within their own star system and later clashing with neighboring stellar powers such as the Pact Worlds and the Swarm. Currently, the Veskarium is at war with the Azlanti Star Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures, creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Their brutal history and militaristic values shape vesk, who often embrace conflict and value strength, duty, and a personal code of honor. Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and sport, and some vesk might abandon or oppose the ruthless values enforced by the rulers of their home worlds entirely. It's up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a collaborator—or something else entirely.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who's duty bound, brave, and stoic, you should play a vesk.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Relish the chance to prove yourself in combat against worthy opponents.</li>\n<li>Have a strong sense of duty and honor.</li>\n<li>Surprise your companions with tenderness and emotional outbursts in private.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect and fear your brutal reputation but appreciate your strength as an ally.</li>\n<li>Mistake your stoicism for heartlessness.</li>\n<li>Fear facing you in battle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Vesk stand up to 7 feet tall, are generally muscular, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Spiky horns grow from their skulls and form bony “beards” along their jaws that sometimes extend down their spines to their powerful tails. Vesk scales are generally shades of green but can also display vibrant, mottled coloration that's sometimes considered an indicator of health and attractiveness.</p>\n<p>Vesk adopted tech weapons early in their history but retain the brutal claws and teeth of natural predators. They take great care in grooming and painting their scales and claws to showcase their personal style and intimidate others.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. Vesk first dwelled on a single planet but quickly spread to other worlds in their system. Today, the name for these conquered worlds is the Veskarium, with each given a number to mark their distance from the sun and order of conquest (such as Vesk-3 or Vesk-8). Vesk Prime, the vesk ancestral home, is the seat of Veskarium government and the heart of their culture.</p>\n<p>Vesk names typically combine elements of their parents' names as well as those of other prominent ancestors. Companions often shorten these names for casual use, but doing so without permission is a grave insult. Some vesk take on epithets that signify their victories in combat, such as “Three Guns,” “Voidwalker,” or “Squadeater.”</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Abazobari, Ahadigar, Asthonad, Dotralan, Evdokayo, Julukesh, Katara, Obozaya, Oromeras, Radokama, Sarangari, Sobok, Terikoraz, Vindasorn, Yuluzak</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Most vesk in the Veskarium venerate Damoritosh the Conqueror, god of duty and war, and his army of battle saints. In life, the saints were mortal paragons who embodied vesk cultural values and attained divinity after earning Damoritosh's blessing; now they're worshipped alongside their deity. A typical vesk faces all of life's struggles armed with ideals of personal honor and strength, recognizing that not all conflicts occur on the battlefield. Many vesk find comfort in rigid systems of law, while others hold their personal sense of morality above all else—in either case, most vesk don't hesitate to fight for what they believe is right. Even while fighting, most vesk apply a code to their actions, and conflicts within the Veskarium tend to be as disciplined as they are violent, stretching to accommodate opposing sides following the prescribed order of war. A typical vesk always respects their opponent and shuns cowardly tactics, such as executing prisoners or harming civilians.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>battle honorably, keep private emotions in check, never show weakness to enemies</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>betray an ally, give up the fight</p>\n<h2>Vesk Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Strength, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vesk, One regional language of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Astrazoans rarely show this natural form to other creatures and keep their ancestral origins secret, mostly because even they don't know where they came from.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can change their body to adopt new identities and expressions, you should play an astrazoan.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Revel in experiencing new cultures.</li>\n<li>Enjoy shifting between identities to suit different situations.</li>\n<li>Only reveal your natural form to your closest friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Envy your shapeshifting and believe it's effortless.</li>\n<li>Are surprised by your knowledge of other cultures.</li>\n<li>Struggle to recognize you in all your different shapes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>An astrazoan's most iconic physical feature is their ability to mold their own hyper-flexible body into many different forms. Contorting their limbs, redistributing their jellylike flesh, and shifting their organs with long, muscular tendons allows astrazoans to assume new appearances that can be maintained unconsciously once locked into place. The transformation is swift and fluid but accompanied by visceral pops and cracks, the pain of which is quickly offset by a rush of endorphins that help the astrazoan cope with their new form.</p>\n<p>In their natural form, an astrazoan resembles a radially symmetrical starfish with five to seven limbs and spiny crevices in their soft underbelly that protect their delicate cilia, eyes, and other organs. Covered in dermal papillae, their leathery skin can shift color and texture, which newborn astrazoans use to mimic their surroundings. A fleshy sack forms a hump at the center of astrazoan's body, containing extra tissue astrazoans can redistribute as desired to transform into larger shapes. Some astrazoans implant cybernetics into their bodies, which they can shift to take on even more varied forms.</p>\n<p>Everything about astrazoans is malleable, even their intestines. In their natural form, astrazoans eject their stomachs from their mouths to externally digest food before slurping it back into their bodies. Astrazoans have learned to eat in a manner consistent with whatever shape they take without sacrificing the flavor or nutrient quality of their meal, and most astrazoans figure out early on in adapting to a new culture that their species' primary method of ingestion can be unsettling or even repulsive in front of others.</p>\n<p>Young astrazoans and those who have remained in the same form for many years might struggle when it's time to adopt a new “skin,” the word astrazoans tend to use for a borrowed shape. They often struggle with the same details regardless of which species they mimic, perhaps adding extra fingers to the same hand or always growing an eyeball on the same kneecap. Even after mastering their new form, it can take months before an astrazoan stops double-checking the same part of their body to make sure that the skin has kicked that troublesome habit. As they age, most astrazoans develop and compartmentalize up to seven selves, stored in each of their arm's neural networks. While each self has a distinct appearance, personality, and experiences, an astrazoan's true self is a blended plurality encompassing the many facets of their alternate personas. Mature astrazoans can try out new skins at will but spend most of their time wearing skins associated with their arms' neural networks, living as a fully realized identity related to their gestalt personality while in that form. The same kind of flexibility of self extends to their gender identity and gender expression, resulting in a dominant personality that's often extremely genderfluid.</p>\n<p>When an astrazoan changes to a different form, it's difficult to tell them apart from another member of the species they're mimicking. A thorough medical examination usually reveals idiosyncrasies leading to discovery of an astrazoan's true nature, but practiced astrazoans conceal their natures so well that sometimes, even their closest loved ones don't discover the truth.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>What astrazoans lack in a unified ancestral identity, they make up for with an uncanny ability to adapt to the cultures and habits of nearly any other species. Astrazoan mimicry extends beyond physical shape to copying behaviors, mannerisms, dietary preferences, language and speech tics, and sometimes even the innate abilities of the species with whom they assimilate. Astrazoans infrequently encounter one another, so many start families with members of their host species or reproduce by budding. Most astrazoans eventually reproduce in some way, seeing it as their responsibility to continue the species.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, astrazoans keep their natural form hidden to avoid unsettling others. A few astrazoans love to show off their natural forms and minimize their time wearing other skins. An astrazoan performing a dance routine that incorporates fluid shape changes is a breathtaking sight, though historically, it's a spectacle relatively few other people get to witness.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Most astrazoans use a different name for each of their identities, but this isn't always the case. It is not uncommon for astrazoans to change their names over time, but most have a true name of unknown linguistic origin that they most associate with themselves. While some astrazoans openly go by their true name, most tend to only share it with their most trusted allies or other astrazoans.

        "Contemplative": {
          "name": "Contemplative",
          "text": "<p>As Akiton's core cooled and its atmosphere thinned, contemplatives' distant ancestors sought shelter in underground sanctuaries. Life underground was incredibly different than on the surface, and though today no one knows what the first contemplatives might have looked like or what their cultural traditions might have been, those who weathered their planet's changes realized they would need to change to adapt to the new paradigm. And thus contemplatives turned away from the laborious routines of farming, hunting, and building on the surface. Instead, they began to explore a new frontier: the esoteric realms of the mind.</p>\n<p>Through magically guided evolution, each generation grew larger brains and frailer bodies, dedicating themselves to the pursuit of knowledge rather than the struggle for survival. Today, contemplatives are hyper-specialized thinkers, able to unravel secrets at a whim and reflexively generate psychic forces. Space travel has lured many of the reclusive philosophers from their isolated Akitonian communes, promising them countless discoveries and data beyond the stars.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a mental powerhouse with innate psychic abilities, you should play a contemplative.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Overcomplicate challenges, often just to test your abilities and hypotheses.</li>\n<li>Dislike pointless noise and mayhem that distracts you from deeper thought.</li>\n<li>Dedicate yourself to mastering some great mystery, magical tradition, or field of study.</li>\n<li>Refer to yourself as we, not I.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you know almost everything about anything.</li>\n<li>Are reticent to voice their thoughts around you, believing you'll relentlessly lecture them or question their epistemological foundation.</li>\n<li>Treat you as a fragile oddity, assuming you're unable to perform simple tasks with your vestigial anatomy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Through untold generations of selective and psychically guided evolution, contemplatives have transformed from some long- forgotten species with humanlike proportions into immense brains with mere vestiges of their abdomens and limbs dangling underneath like the gondola of some cerebral blimp.</p>\n<p>The immense brain is roughly 70 pounds of a typical contemplative's 100-pound weight. Hardened layers of skin and cartilage cover the exterior, giving the brain a tough yet extremely pliable texture. The huge brain isn't just for show; a contemplative can store and process vast amounts of information by running independent conscious and subconscious processes subdivided across its four quadrants. Two quadrants handle tasks like motor function, language, and reasoning, akin to a human brain's two hemispheres.</p>\n<p>Though capable of conscious thought too, the other two quadrants primarily generate a contemplative's psychic fields. Buoyed by this telekinetic force, a contemplative learns to fly with precision, if not always with speed. Even more importantly, a contemplative's telekinetic field helps support the brain; the organ lacks the structure needed to maintain its shape in standard gravity without psychic support. If rendered truly unconscious, a contemplative risks suffocation, internal bleeding, and weeklong migraines if they survive. Fortunately, they instinctively rest portions of their brain at different times, much like aquatic mammals, in a process called logging.</p>\n<p>By comparison, a contemplative's lower body seems puny. Tight skin covers its gaunt frame, with spiky bones showing where powerful muscles might have attached themselves millennia ago. A contemplative has two sets of forelimbs, akin to a shirren, with only the upper set capable of manipulating objects in any meaningful way. The lower set act more like antennae, parsing olfactory and tactile information. A contemplative often hovers over a curiosity to analyze it with an array of senses, including the eyes that jut out a short distance from beneath the brain.</p>\n<p>Their legs have slightly more strength than their arms. If necessary, a contemplative can waddle short distances before tiring. More often, though, their legs act as stabilizers for pushing off surfaces and reorienting the body in midair.</p>\n<p>Some contemplatives find the concept of having a vestigial body at all so distasteful or unnecessary that they wear garments designed to veil it completely, giving them the appearance of a ghostly brain trailing a billowing shroud beneath them.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Contemplative society carefully straddles the competing objectives of isolation and connection. A contemplative thrives in quiet spaces where they're shielded from distractions so they can dive deep into thought. On Akiton, they carved out vast caverns and subterranean cities that didn't just block conventional noise; these places deflected cosmic rays, radiation, and other minute signals that could distract a contemplative's acute senses. Their brains are like great telescopes, working best when far away from the pollution of others' thoughts while they strain to hear the universe's psychic signatures. In practice, this preference for isolation gives many contemplatives an aloof, standoffish quality that discourages some would-be companions.</p>\n<p>At the same time, contemplatives have evolved to crave community. The same psychic fields that buoy a contemplative's mass also radiate telepathic signals that act like mental pheromones. Contemplatives subconsciously network and compare notes when living together, borrowing each other's perspectives and mental processing power. This chatter reflexively communicates their biases and moods, which has trained most contemplatives to be straightforward, analytical, and (by most creatures' standards) brash when they openly psychoanalyze and second-guess others. For a contemplative, sugar-coating feedback risks muddling the message.</p>\n<p>Though unflinching honesty and dispassionate feedback are deeply valued among contemplative communities, contemplatives who leave the forums of Akiton quickly catch onto and master societal norms, learning to tiptoe around, appreciate, or even exploit others' taboos. After all, chasing away potential colleagues would deny a contemplative the comforting hum of others' thoughts. Adventuring contemplatives enjoy company for another reason: personal drive. Each companion is a potential rival or measuring stick against which a contemplative can judge their own worth, fueling their drive to learn more and (inevitably) outclass those around them. Half the time, a companion isn't even aware that their contemplative friend is engaged in this personal quest for dominance and validation.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Eskari's Third Concerto, Bones Land in a Spiral 16:3, Pokolv's Last Koan, Drift's Gravitational Constant, Toshoo Verse 4, Sonnet on Desna's Wing, Castrovelian Symmetry Paradox, Battle of Purple Valkyries.</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>To a contemplative, understanding is a matter of experimentation, philosophizing, discovery, and hard work. By contrast, divine revelation is a grotesque exercise that needs stronger citations. As a result, contemplatives rarely acknowledge deities through worship. Instead, gods are treated like famous colleagues and living libraries in the greater cosmos important (and often biased) sources of information that can help a contemplative unravel even greater truths. Any god who demands obedience, commands pointless rituals, or makes unsubstantiated claims about reality earns few contemplative followers.</p>\n<p>Contemplatives respect and might obliquely worship deities who encourage their followers to research cosmic answers for themselves. The likes of Eloritu and Yaraesa are natural fits. Their edicts encourage what most contemplatives were already doing, but some commune with these deities as a student might with their academic advisor, seeking guidance and occasional collaboration. Ibra, Oras, and the Newborn are more like divine puzzles whom some contemplatives simultaneously worship and endeavor to decipher; if those deities hold more unsolved mysteries, they're worthy of further praise and attention. Those contemplatives dedicated to specific fields such as sociology and technology gravitate toward gods like Talavet and Triune. Finally, gods of community like Hylax and Lambatuin sometimes earn contemplative priests; however, some of these followers try to establish a permanent telepathic rapport with their patron as if they were another contemplative, often resulting in a flood of oracular (and cursed) insight.</p>\n<p>The esoteric concept of Ashok lies at the center of contemplative belief. Exactly what Ashok is varies by the individual and the historian anything from a philosophical system to a legendary seer in the past to a mystical state of enlightenment yet to be achieved. Whatever definition a contemplative adopts, the concept of Ashok is one of aspiration and reverence. It goads a contemplative out of complacency, urging them to keep learning, exploring, and striving. Truly mastering Ashok would be a presumptuous claim; it's an indefinite process, perhaps on par with becoming a god or transforming into a being of pure thought. It's almost as presumptuous for a non-contemplative to engage with Ashok, much less claim to understand it. Few outsiders earn the honor of being initiated in the Ashok mysteries.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>collaborate with peers to overcome problems, embrace moments of solitude and silence, engage in deep self-reflection, excel in a specialized field, seek Ashok</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>be content with simple explanations to complex problems, corrupt groundbreaking research, make assertions without evidence, suffer ignorance, value feelings over facts</p>\n<h2>Contemplative Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 5 Feet (Hover); Fly 20 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Akitonian, Common</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

        "Dragonkin": {
          "name": "Dragonkin",
          "text": "<p>The first dragonkin were born from deep bonds of love between dragons and humanoids using complex rituals and special materials found only on the planet Triaxus. It's been millennia since the first dragonkin were born, and they have long since disconnected from dragons—they have their own cultural traditions, societies, and lineages, independent of their distant draconic forebears. Despite the ages, the love that gave birth to them endures in the partner bond—a deep spiritual connection that every dragonkin can forge with one other person.</p>\n<p>On the surface, a partner bond is a telepathic connection forged through emotion. It enables a bonded pair to communicate telepathically and react as one, providing advantages in battle, sport, and countless other avenues. Looking deeper, a partner bond can only be formed through mutual devotion and love—whether romantic, platonic, or familial—and is nigh unbreakable. It's not a bond to be entered into frivolously, nor can it be forced or severed by anything other than death or the will of the gods. While the tactical applications of a partner bond are extensive, it can never be “turned off” or ignored, and all outside relationships must bend to accommodate it—rarely is there a loyalty that partners place above one another.</p>\n<p>Dragonkin are extremely social. Their innate empathy and intuition makes them simultaneously cautious and earnest; they tend to approach new people and situations with care, form an opinion rapidly, then trust their own gut judgment, even if it might conflict with the opinions of others or cause strife. A dragonkin's behavior is usually tempered by their sense of duty and responsibility. A dragonkin with few connections—or who shows little regard for others—can cause a lot of havoc.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character who is strong and resilient, embraces their emotions, and forms deep bonds of friendship and community, you should play a dragonkin.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Share your feelings with everyone around you.</li>\n<li>Trust your instincts more than you trust established facts.</li>\n<li>Prioritize your bonded partner's needs and wants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are intimidated by you.</li>\n<li>Underestimate the strength of your bond with your partner.</li>\n<li>Find it disconcerting when you and your partner act in perfect unison.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>As their name implies, dragonkin are draconic in appearance, with broad wings, hard scales, long tails, horns, and a powerful physique. Some even have the deadly breath of their dragon progenitors, but the breath's type and characteristics depend on a number of factors, many of which aren't well understood. Dragonkin vary between 8–20 feet long head to tail and can weigh over 2,000 pounds, but in the modern era a smaller size has proven advantageous.</p>\n<p>A dragonkin's scale color has nothing to do with their origins, heritage, home world, or surroundings. Most are monochromatic, though some have scales in two or three similar tones, most often in a gradient or speckled pattern. Most dragonkin polish their scales to a reflective shine and take particular pride in the appearance of their scales at certain times of the day or under certain lighting— under moonlight is most common.</p>\n<p>Dragonkin occasionally paint their claws and horns with various colors and patterns, though very few modify or dye their scales—certainly not permanently! Dragonkin looking to temporarily change the appearance of their scales prefer holographic overlays, augmented reality, or magical illusions. The notable exception to this trend involves dolek (pronounced doe-wek), the traditional ritual of removing a single scale from one's body and fashioning it into a wearable gift for one's bonded partner. In the distant past, the scale removed came from the back—the place that a bonded partner would sit upon one's back if ridden. Today, it's more common to remove a scale from above the heart. In either case, the gift of a dolek is a symbol that a dragonkin trusts their partner to protect their weak spots, physically, psychologically, and emotionally.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The history, society, and culture of dragonkin is inexorably linked with that of their home world, Triaxus, where they've lived alongside ryphorians and dragons since time immemorial. Triaxus has an exaggerated elliptical orbit that causes grueling, century-long winters and summers, with only a short transitional season between them. Adaptation, whether biological or behavioral, has always been integral to survival, and even today dragonkin greatly value adaptability, willingness to persevere through trying situations, and ability to survive nature's many trials. The methods one uses to accomplish these feats—from physical prowess or mental cunning to magical support or cybernetic augmentations—are universally lauded.</p>\n<p>Dragonkin have a combative history. Long before the Gap, battles between Triaxus's peoples were widespread, motivated by territorial disputes and aeons-old draconic rivalries. In this distant era, dragonkin warriors carried ryphorian riders into battle in formation with powerful dragon allies. These battle pairings were the typical and most iconic of all partner bonds, and their legacy still lives on today. Dragonkin remain most likely to partner with ryphorians over other ancestries, and one of the most respected mercenary leagues of the modern era is the spacefaring Skyfire Legion. Although dragonkin fulfill countless roles in society, they remain best known in the greater galaxy for their intimidating appearance and military expertise. Even those dragonkin who avoid confrontation or abhor violence learn to defend themselves—or the people they care about—in times of peril.</p>\n<p>Dragonkin society is based around partnership. On a micro scale, the partner bond anchors daily life, but on a macro scale, everything revolves around community. Everything dragonkin create, from architecture and infrastructure to laws and media, reflects the importance of partnership.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Akrodo, Aralyx, Axiennex, Beshikasiss, Binata, Darzalfen, Dissidanth, Egelmyr, Endrisarn, Estrikkon, Farvenzi, Ganifrae, Heraxia, Kahore, Krellenor, Lourvictrix, Phixara, Raskurenn, Selkirrik, Sozirenn, Tarke, Tsalu, Tykkendrin, Zendegos, Ziotris</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Dragonkin place great value on interpersonal relationships and social skills, yet they recognize that the ability to be charming, or a good friend or partner, is independent of one's moral standing and ethical stance. They're naturally strong, and most embrace the legacy of their ancestors by learning to defend themselves or to dominate the field of battle. Driven by the need to survive the harsh and dangerous environment of their home world, dragonkin strive to adapt, survive, and persevere using any means available. Most dragonkin worship gods that speak to one of these values, such as Damoritosh, Eloritu, Hylax, Oras, Talavet, or Dagosarn, the Triaxian god of community, partnerships, and the bond.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>protect your partner, engage positively with your community, fight to defend your beliefs and allies</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>act with cowardice, betray your partner, purposefully isolate yourself</p>\n<h2>Dragonkin Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 Feet; Fly 20 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Two free attribute boosts</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic, Triaxian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> Additional languages equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).

          "text": "<p></p>\n<p>Elebrians are the last living descendants of the prominent species that once called the planet Eox home, prior to a terrible and mysterious cataclysm that burned away its atmosphere and immolated the planet's living flora and fauna. The undead necrovites—once elebrians who transformed themselves with magical ritual to survive on their ruined world—ruled Eox while a small community of living elebrians remained trapped in a facility buried beneath Deminas Hollow. Other groups of elebrians might have survived in isolated bunkers across Eox, but today the population is concentrated in the Halls of the Living, an underground media complex where the living provide entertainment for an undead audience.</p>\n<p>Elebrians are born with a sixth sense for magic. Thanks to special structures in their brains that cause their enlarged heads, elebrians literally feel magical energies. Elebrians who learn to hone their special sense often become powerful sages who command the elements, parse arcane theory, or even rewrite reality.</p>\n<p>Elebrians tend to have even features with enlarged craniums, high foreheads, and skin tones that vary from pale to deep umber. Most modern elebrians don't feel connected to ancient cultures that were prominent before the near extinction of their species. Modern elebrian culture isn't based on ethnicity or religion—it's based on commercial media. Only the few elebrians whose families left the Halls of the Living when they were children, or who were raised in extremely rare outsider communities, could claim to have led a “normal” life by anyone else's standards.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a character with a flair for the dramatic and a strangely sheltered background who's experiencing the wider galaxy for the first time, you should consider playing an elebrian.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do whatever it takes to survive.</li>\n<li>Rebelliously seek to free your species from their so-called “lives” on Eox.</li>\n<li>Think you know more about entertainment than others do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you have connections with the undead necrovites of Eox or even groups like the Corpse Fleet.</li>\n<li>Wonder if you're being your true self or just playing another role.</li>\n<li>Recognize you from past media appearances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>The most notable physical feature of elebrians is their enlarged cranium and distended forehead, evolved to house their enlarged brains possessing specialized arcane sensory organs. From the neck down, elebrians look nearly indistinguishable from a human, keeping alive fringe theories about them sharing evolutionary ancestors with humans. Most mature elebrians are 5 to 6 feet tall, with a range of peach to tan skin tones and mostly dark black, blue, or brown eyes. Elebrians are usually completely hairless, except for a rare few individuals who manage to grow thin eyebrows, mustaches, or even a once-in-a-generation goatee. Some elebrians wear opulent headdresses on their bald heads or cover their crowns with elaborate tattoos, tending to favor brighter colors than their necrovite counterparts.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>In general, elebrians are hearty and stoic, accepting what they're given and striving to make the best of it. Modern elebrian cultures have drifted far from what existed before the calamitous Death Wail, and mainstream elebrian society on Eox is centered around the pursuit of fame and creating or consuming entertainment.</p>\n<p>Elebrians who grow up in the Halls of the Living become accustomed to cameras and performing for an audience from early childhood, though they legally aren't allowed to appear on Zo! Media programming before reaching adulthood. Zo! Media continues sponsoring “scholarships” for young elebrians who want to “study abroad,” code for relocation to a planet where they can live their life off- screen.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ahmzovar, Auradorus, Elyriana, Eterrina, Fenthest, Genarathis, Missavuine, Sadrat, Sanimus, Scaparitos, Shathrava, Telmarcius, Thesteline, Veltheniel</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Many elebrians lead strangely sheltered lives, but those residing in the Halls of the Living are bombarded with media from all over the galaxy, exposing them to a multitude of new ideas. Some elebrians handpick their own eclectic beliefs or adopt the traditions of another culture. Eloritu and Lambatuin are popular choices for elebrians who worship deities. Elebrian society tends to be atheistic. Any ancestral gods have long been forgotten or abandoned in favor of the neon gods of the silver screen. Many elebrians on Eox follow the Song of Silence, a philosophy that teaches that a being's mortal life is simply a trial run for one's second, undead existence. Eventually, most elebrians seek to transition into undeath when faced with the prospect of aging, long-term illness, or death. Elebrians who die naturally are rare, and the choice to do so is perceived as unusual by their Eoxian cohorts.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>live a life worth remembering, play your part, seek fame</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>allow yourself to fade away</p>\n<h2>Elebrian Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Eoxian</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Ikeshtis are conditioned by their environment—the harsh deserts, hills, and badlands of the planet Akiton, a dwindling world low in resources and opportunities. They're hardy and resilient, capable of surviving over a week without food or water. Each generation forms its own tight-knit communities, which vary dramatically, from nomadic tribes and agrarian homesteads to roving biker gangs, mercantile empires, and everything in between. Most ikeshtis who leave their community send support back home, usually in the form of resources, information, or credits.</p>\n<p>Shaped by scarcity, ikeshtis loathe wastefulness and rarely consider anything worthless—what can't be reused can be repaired, repurposed, or broken down for parts and crafted into something new. Many ikeshtis take pride in their thriftiness and have honed their skills with a tangible craft or trade. Like many inhabitants of Akiton, ikeshtis view every junkyard, scrapheap, and forgotten wreck as a promising opportunity. They're well known for their ingenuity and craftiness, and many ikeshti communities make their living as salvagers, scrap traders, and mechanics.</p>\n<p>Ikeshtis are passionate and experience intense emotions, which are magnified by stress and danger. Many ikeshtis have difficulty processing their emotions in a healthy way, so modern ikeshtis learn to confront and embrace—not ignore—their emotions, develop routines and behaviors to help them de-stress or center themselves, and confide in trusted friends. Most ikeshtis are mercurial and experience frequent mood swings. When emotionally overwhelmed or frustrated, they're prone to outbursts of sadness or aggression. This has given ikeshtis a reputation for being hotheaded, temperamental, and prone to sudden violence.</p>\n<p>Juvenile ikeshtis and adults who fail to develop the maturity necessary to process their emotions, additionally risk entering the dreaded rivener state when stressed or frustrated. This sudden transformation engorges the body, making the ikeshti bigger and stronger, but completely overrides their mind with anger. A rivener violently rampages, destroying everything and everyone in their path, often harming their own communities and kin. This transformation is short-lived and exhausting, lasting until the ikeshti calms or runs out of energy. Ikeshtis consider the rivener state incredibly embarrassing—like having an incoherent temper tantrum in public. Some ikeshtis can enter the rivener state intentionally, maintaining their mental faculties during the transformation, to gain strength in a desperate situation. Ironically, mastering the rivener transformation requires extreme emotional control, and such ikeshtis are highly respected.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a creative and passionate survivor, who values their community and is determined in the face of complications and hardship, you should play an ikeshti.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enjoy finding new purposes for old things and giving broken things new life.</li>\n<li>Feel a deep connection to your community and its members and strive to ensure their continued survival or prosperity.</li>\n<li>Experience mood swings, or frequently feel emotionally overwhelmed.</li>\n<li>Be introspective and invest in your mental health, likely having favorite hobbies, preferred routines, a trusted confidante, or practiced behaviors you engage in to de-stress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Are impressed by your ingenuity.</li>\n<li>Assume your fondness for used and found objects indicates a lack of financial resources.</li>\n<li>Consider you temperamental and melodramatic.</li>\n<li>Worry you'll transform into a monster if they make you angry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Ikeshtis are bipedal reptiles with a long tail, taloned hands, and an elongated snout. They're small and compact, averaging between 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 feet tall. Their hard scales are red, sometimes with brown, orange, or pink gradations. Most have frills running down the back of their head and neck, with spurs on the elbows or knees, sharp teeth, and yellow eyes. Some ikeshtis grow downward-curving horns on the side of their head, though this is most common in elder ikeshtis and those who frequently enter the rivener state.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Ikeshtis are defined by their communities throughout their lives, beginning with the brood. A brood is a voracious swarm of infants hatched from numerous egg clutches and raised by brood-minders—ikeshtis who specialize in nurturing and educating juveniles. Ikeshti hatchlings are little more than gaping mouths with tails, driven by hunger, who sprout additional appendages as they age. They instinctively seek one another's company, forming roving groups that mindlessly consume organic matter. Broods can easily decimate a region's flora and fauna or tear through a settlement, so brood-minders ensure their broods eat responsibly. These efforts protect local ecosystems and keep broods safe from predators and angry locals.</p>\n<p>As hatchlings mature, brood-minders begin a more formal education, teaching important life skills such as speech, responsible feeding, emotional awareness, and the dangers of the rivener state. Through action, ikeshtis learn personal responsibility, communal prosperity, and collaboration.</p>\n<p>After five years, ikeshtis outgrow their brood and form their own unique groups. Many of these fledgling communities begin as nomadic wanderers, agrarian farmers, crafty salvagers, or opportunistic gangs, though they change with time, adapting their lifestyle as they gain experience or innovate. Communities form alliances with one another for protection, companionship, and trade, forming a complex web of relations and alliances that enable communities to thrive as part of a wider whole. Sometimes communities merge into larger units, but never become untenantable, always remaining within the threshold of what their environment can safely support.</p>\n<p>As ikeshti communities are diverse in form and function, there are few universals. Each finds a method to balance economic prosperity with social satisfaction, usually leveraging their ingenuity and mechanical skills to great effect. Warriors, hunters, scouts, and salvagers are all important, as are healers and community leaders. Soul- soothers (therapists) and brood-minders are typically the most honored roles in a community.</p>\n<p>Ikeshtis rarely show interest in procreation and, when they do, few follow through, mindful of the burden a brood will place on their region. Ikeshtis lay large clutches of eggs away from their communities, which are tended by brood-minders. As guiding a brood takes an ikeshti away from their own community for years at a time, only the most patient, nurturing, and self-sacrificing ikeshtis take on the role. Brood-minders are supported by their closest companions—usually other brood-minders, friends, and lovers. For their tenure, brood-minders are very protective of their brood, becoming surly and standoffish. When their brood begins to form communities and drift away from the nest, brood-minders return to their own communities with pride.</p>\n<p>Surviving on Akiton is hard, so every community has members who choose to leave home (often the planet entirely) for new opportunities. Most send money, information, or supplies back home, remotely funding their community. Many find work as miners, engineers, mechanics, entrepreneurs, or gladiators, or enter the entertainment industry, chasing fame and fortune in music or sports. Others set out intentionally to acquire goods, trade deals, assets, and funds that can be directly funneled to their communities. Many join corporations such as AbadarCorp, form business ventures, and trade in stocks. Regardless of methods or goals, ikeshtis who send funds home are called congregants.</p>\n<p>The arrival of the Wreck of the Returned drew the attention of many communities and countless congregants, all eager to explore the wreck, discover new technology, and repurpose interesting salvage. Many have settled in the boomtown of Pilferer's Paradise or teamed up with factions leading expeditions to the wreck, including the Starfinder Society.</p>\n<p>Ikeshti naming conventions vary by community, but often favor fricative sounds and plosive consonants.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Asashla, Bishae, Dezall, Geffi, Friyen, Ifray, Kish, Merthinett, Nenvi, Pavail, Quesch, Sehvash, Throsh, Tikesh, Vadak, Veke, Vertassh, Voss</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Traditionally, ikeshtis give little thought to organized religion, favoring devotion to one's broodmates and community. Today, they worship a diverse array of gods, with nothing considered foreign or strange. Many worship gods that reflect their communal lifestyles, such as Hylax or Talavet. Nomadic groups feel kinship with Weydan, and those of a more warlike bent favor Damoritosh or Besmara. Congregants tend to prefer Abadar or Lambatuin.</p>\n<p>Very rarely, ikeshtis become zealous prophets who receive visions and wisdom from unspecified forces. The source of these premonitions is a mystery, although the naturally appearing sigils on their scales suggest Eloritu or the newly hatched Newborn may be involved, or else something foul from the fringes of existence or the dark places between the stars.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>respect the mental health of yourself and others, protect your community, reuse and repurpose goods and materials, be thrifty</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>suppress or ignore your emotions, betray those close to you, cause wanton destruction, be wasteful</p>\n<h2>Ikeshti Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet; Climb 15 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Akitonian, Common, One regional language of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Though the last of the linnorms were killed long ago, kalos remain vigilant in military training and traditions. Their fearsome reputation keeps kalo soldiers and mercenaries in high demand.</p>\n<p>Today, kalos thrive in dense, expanding cities clustered around warm geothermal vents on the ocean floor. Artists, performers, inventors, and creators of custom goods find a ready market in Kalo-Mahoi's seas. Visitors come from all over the Pact Worlds to explore the galleries, fashion houses, and submarine vistas of these bright, colorful urban centers.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who's tough, creative, and one of a kind, try playing a kalo!</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be inspired by exploring the beauty of nature.</li>\n<li>Make friends in unexpected places.</li>\n<li>Personalize your equipment as a means of self-expression.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask you for style advice.</li>\n<li>Assume you're out of your element on land.</li>\n<li>Fear your martial prowess.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Kalos are aquatic humanoids covered in scales that appear predominantly blue and green, though occasionally pale pink or gray as well. They range from five to six feet tall as adults, but their slight builds and cartilaginous skeletons mean they average just under 100 pounds in weight. Wings of translucent membrane connect kalos' arms and legs, helping them to move effortlessly through the water. Sensory tendrils cover the lower halves of their faces, surrounding mouths full of small, needlelike teeth. Their large eyes can move and focus independently to sense predators and prey alike and faintly glow with a soft luminescence that kalos use as a means of silently signaling each other. An array of decorative spines sweeps back from their forehead down through the base of their skull. Kalos breathe through gills that only function in water, so they typically wear fluid-filled helmets, respirators, or full environmental suits when on land. Even so, they must periodically immerse themselves in water lest their scales dry out and painfully flake away.</p>\n<p>Artistic self-expression is very important to kalo cultures, and nowhere is it more prevalent than on kalo bodies. The most common target of alteration are a kalo's decorative spines, which they frequently pierce, color, or shape, often changing them many times over the course of a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Kalos also frequently modify their sensory tendrils and wings as well as their bioluminescent eyes, which they often recolor with tinted lenses. In addition, kalo industry has developed extremely effective underwater makeup compounds, of which many kalos make frequent and dramatic use.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Today, most kalos live in densely populated metropolises with access to magitech amenities that make life extremely comfortable and safe. Centered around warm geothermal vents that provide ample energy for their needs, cities on Kalo-Mahoi are busy hubs of industry, art, and technology, and most continue to expand. Colorful and bright, these cities are welcoming beacons to locals and tourists who flock to them seeking excitement, fortune, and like-minded communities. Kalo cities usually have extensive bubble districts filled with breathable atmosphere that makes them more hospitable to air-breathing visitors from offworld.</p>\n<p>For kalos, life is art. Kalo-Mahoi's breathtaking architecture, groundbreaking art, and fresh fashion draw visitors from around the Pact Worlds, especially the Deep Gala that transforms Grand Inza into a uniquely designed paradise every year. Because of the value placed on artistic pursuits, many kalos highly value customized and unique versions of everyday items. Industries based on crafting bespoke clothing, cutlery, furniture, vehicles, weapons, and myriad other things thrive in kalo culture, and these custom goods are in high demand both on and off Kalo-Mahoi.</p>\n<p>Thanks in part to abundant sources of geothermal energy and primal magic, kalo society quickly developed the political will to preserve the natural wonders of their home. Significant public investment into magitech systems for waste recycling and pollutant sequestration prevented the waters of Kalo- Mahoi from suffering the fate of many rapidly industrializing worlds. Kalos designate vast swaths of wilderness as nature preserves, though some activists see the kalos' rapid urban growth as a threat and push, sometimes violently, for more stringent restrictions. Though most pay lip service to the importance of conservation, many corporate entities and trade organizations quietly lobby for expanded access to natural resources and loosened restrictions, viewing the more ardent conservationists as dire threats to their bottom lines.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Kalo parents often name their children after well-known figures, real or fictional, and alter the name in some way to make it unique. Example kalo names include Huur-Lithu, Olaavhu, Shavhiul, Shuuthul, and Ulluumoth.</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>During their time wreaking havoc on Kalo-Mahoi, linnorms encouraged the worship of Ragadahn of the Eldest, who they consider to be their progenitor. Ancient carvings in sea caves demonstrate that kalos were worshipping Ragadahn for millennia before the arrival of his children. This has led to theories that kalos originally came to Kalo-Mahoi from the First World.</p>\n<p>Today, Ragadahn's faith is greatly diminished, many seeing it as a remnant of their people's long oppression. Some still hold to the traditional faith, however, praying to Ragadahn as a force to be appeased. Other faiths enjoy scattered popularity among the population, including Eloritu, Weydan, and Zon-Shelyn.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>celebrate and encourage diversity in all things, leave everywhere you go more beautiful than you found it</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>betray an alliance, disrespect another's self-expression</p>\n<h2>Kalo Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 Feet; Swim 30 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Constitution</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> equal to your, Intelligence modifier (if it's positive)., Choose from the list of common, languages and any other languages, to which you have access (such as, the languages prevalent on your, home world).</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> Common Kalo</p>\n<p><strong>Traits</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"tags paizo-style\">\n<li class=\"tag traits\">aquatic</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">humanoid</li>\n<li class=\"tag traits\">kalo</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Senses</strong> Darkvision</p>\n<p><strong>Hydration</strong></p>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.sf2e.ancestry-features.Item.ViiaTAW4zaoaYeim inline]</p>\n<h2>Kalo Heritages</h2>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.heritages.Item.v1FRU6XUr7QZsG6d]{Bloom-Born Kalo}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.heritages.Item.Ey2iWNKXd8rzHP2J]{Deep Kalo}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.heritages.Item.ZAOKze0PTYPPbUua]{Electric Kalo}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.heritages.Item.8xJLb7SmPydkTzfG]{Outworlder Kalo}</p>\n<p></p>"

          "text": "<p></p>\n<p>Khizars are intelligent plants who live in harmony with nature and have learned to communicate telepathically with other creatures.</p>\n<p>Khizars evolved in the deep jungles of Ukulam on Castrovel, beginning as carrion-feeding plants who hunted dying animals with crude empathic senses and slow, patient movements. Many scientists believe they evolved from the same parent clade as ksariks, who share genetic similarities but lack the complex nervous systems that have allowed khizars to develop true sapience and the ability to communicate with other species.</p>\n<p>Khizars thrive on Castrovel, but they've also spread to other ecosystems such as Aballon's Ice Wells and the Idari's contained nature preserves. Khizars often gravitate to positions of leadership where they can nurture community growth or establish wilderness lodges and outposts where they can help others learn to safely and respectfully enjoy the outdoors.</p>\n<p>If you want to play a resilient, patient character with a deep connection to nature, you should play a khizar.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Care about the environment or spend time in nature.</li>\n<li>Speak and move slowly or take your time making decisions.</li>\n<li>Drastically alter your attitude and appearance when the season changes or if you move to a new climate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Notice how nature influences your appearance and health.</li>\n<li>Turn to you for guidance in the wilderness.</li>\n<li>Are curious about your appearance, culture, and origins.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>When a khizar germinates, they begin as a tiny glowing seedpod surrounded by a delicate lattice. Over a period of weeks, tender shoots sprout from the seedpod and cling onto any source of nutrients they find usually an animal carcass or a parent caring for the baby khizar. Over time, the seedling's first shoots toughen and lengthen into vine-like growths. Khizar seedlings spend their first years of life learning to control the vines and don't move much on their own. During this time, seedlings don't need supervision, only nutrition. It's common for a parent to abandon seedlings with an animal carcass and a source of entertainment such as a datapad playing reruns of Zo!'s classic productions for long periods while they search for their family's next source of food.</p>\n<p>Once khizars settle into a favored body shape, they enter the sapling phase of life. The sapling grows their vines into strong, malleable limbs. Some saplings begin training their bodies into familiar shapes to put others at ease, growing two arms, two legs, a torso, and a large seedpod where a head would be, but many khizars prefer shapes that mimic the flora and fauna of the wilds where they first took root.</p>\n<p>Sometime between 15 and 30 years of life, a sapling matures and flowers. The first flowering is culturally significant for many khizar populations and signals the passage into adulthood. Khizars rarely change their forms after flowering, and this phase of life is when they're most likely to take up adventuring or settle down in a remote wilderness community, such as the isolated, frozen jungles of Aballon's Ice Wells.</p>\n<p>Khizars naturally live for hundreds of years, but they can die of disease or injury. Wildfires and illegal logging operations are responsible for the deaths of khizars every year.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Some khizars lead solitary lives, competing for resources and only coming together for the mutual protection of germinant seedlings far from mating for life, these loose pairings last a few years at most before the family group disperses to resume their lonely lives scrounging for resources and communicating through complex long-distance signals such as the cultivation of moss and trunk drumming.</p>\n<p>But in the heart of Ukulam and other secluded places, vast groves of khizars dwell in living cities made from the preserved bark of their ancestors, alongside ksariks, who coexist as pets and hunting partners.</p>\n<p>To them, a khizar who leaves the pristine wilds for new horizons or germinates far from home is a wildseed. Wildseeds are everywhere in the galaxy.</p>\n<p>All khizars are born speaking the same slow, creaking language that's nearly impossible for other species to replicate. Khizars seem to share a codex of idioms regardless of where they grew up, mostly based around symbolizing abstract concepts like death and emotions with seasonal changes. Typically, khizar names come from this lexicon. Most khizars earn a name from a caretaker in the first 10 years of their life, but some choose their own names at their first flowering.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Moon Halo Warning, Turning Leaves, North Face Moss, Last Rain Before the Drought, Green Locust Prophec</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Khizars live long, slow lives spent existing in the moment. Some meditate on the nature of reality or commune with divine or primal forces, but khizars find religious dogma needlessly confining and tedious. Instead, most khizars prefer to seek enlightenment through a depth and breadth of life experience.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>enjoy the moment, grow wild, protect nature</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>harm a living creature, exploit natural resources, hinder growth</p>\n<h2>Khizar Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 Feet; Climb 20 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Khizar, Regional language of your choice</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

          "text": "<p>Sarcesians are the inheritors of the Diaspora— descendants of the inhabitants of two destroyed planets called Damiar and Iovo, which now form the Diaspora asteroid belt. At once proud of their history and keen to embrace a brighter future, sarcesians are patient survivors who embrace individualism and the joys of exploration while maintaining connections to their communities and homes. Motivated by a natural love of travel, sarcesians often train as pilots and navigators; rare is the sarcesian who isn't comfortable in the cockpit. Despite their positive outlooks and easygoing natures, some harbor an innate suspicion of inhabitants of the neighboring planet Eox, for it was an Eoxian attack that destroyed their ancestral home worlds in ages long past.</p>\n<p>Sarcesians can survive in space by suspending their respiration and shielding their bodies from the dangers of the void. They manifest a pair of butterfly-like wings made of pure energy that function as solar sails. The sight of a sarcesian in flight is magnificent, and the first dwarven and ysoki miners who met them described encounters with “void angels”.</p>\n<p>Throughout their lives, sarcesians learn control over the energies surrounding them—particularly energy of cosmic origin.

Extremely tall and slender, sarcesians stand between 10 and 15 feet tall and have spindly, elongated limbs and delicate frames. Most are flexible and capable of fitting into surprisingly small spaces.</p>\n<p>They are hairless, with gray skin, pointed ears, and large, luminous eyes. They have keen vision and hearing, but are accustomed to traveling in silence for long periods. They are expressive communicators, punctuating speech with exaggerated facial expressions and hand and body movements. It's common for sarcesians to learn the signed versions of any languages they speak to further facilitate silent communication.</p>\n<p>Sarcesians manifest glorious energy wings and suspend their respiration to endure jaunts in space.</p>\n<p>While sarcesians have no fashion-based taboos, they tend to wear form-fitting attire that covers most of their bodies—a practical choice for those who frequently switch between low gravity and zero gravity environments. As their skin is rarely on display, sarcesians rarely get tattoos or other cosmetic dermal modifications save for those on the face and pate. Most are fond of dramatic makeup. World-bound sarcesians and those who live far from the Diaspora tend to be more audacious and less practical in their attire, following their individual whims whenever their environment is less restrictive.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Sarcesians are a peaceful, libertarian people who dislike formal laws. They maintain a precarious balance between freedom and anarchy, pushing back against authority and societal expectations that infringe upon their personal freedoms and choices, but accepting more subtle and distant boundaries with little complaint. They're averse to imposing their own beliefs on others—even their fellow sarcesians. In fact, most prefer to avoid taking on leadership roles and other positions of power altogether. They're more likely to flee a problem than they are to rebel or lobby for reform. While they don't understand the need for order and conformity (most sarcesians find it suffocating), they don't begrudge those who enjoy it, nor do they strive to overturn it.</p>\n<p>Sarcesians are free-spirited; they do what they want when they want to and believe that everyone deserves to do the same. But this individualism doesn't always equate to spontaneity or unpredictability. Sarcesians are reliable, and many take comfort in routine so long as it's a personal choice and not imposed upon them.</p>\n<p>Sarcesians value family and community, cherishing their friends as much as their own flesh and blood. There is no typical or expected sarcesian coupling—rather, each sarcesian follows their own heart, treating every relationship as its own unique experience. Family units and marriages are rare. Most children are raised on a crèche world by trained crèche-minders— caretakers and educators deeply respected for their patience, diligence, and talents. Despite this hands-off parenting, most develop positive, lifelong relationships with their families.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Alzarin, Auvirre, Centuria, Dezarin, Elgeni, Favienn, Fayetta, Melisar, Mengian, Mirai, Nacoile, Nefain, Novarri, Nykiti, Risiria, Sesiss, Visavra, Vox, Yex, Zunar, Zwarna, Zyym</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Sarcesians are free-spirited libertarians who value their personal independence but don't feel the need to enforce their opinions on others. They value their families and communities even if they rarely engage with them, and they make friends quickly. Sarcesians tend to value honesty and dedication, but not to their detriment—a sarcesian rarely lets concepts like honor or the opinions of others drive them into making a poor decision or doing anything they don't want to do.</p>\n<p>Sarcesians as individuals tend to embrace whatever gods or philosophies catch their interests. As a people, sarcesians are drawn to gods who embrace travel and independence— particularly Weydan.

While these signature weapons are the pride of any shobhad who wields one, they're far from the only one they utilize, and powerful shobhad warriors eagerly wield a variety of two-handed weapons ranging from fangblades and hammers to flamethrowers and machine guns. Even caught off- guard without a weapon, shobhads are respected across the Pact Worlds for their brutal but effective unarmed martial arts.</p>\n<p>If you want a character that is physically imposing, at home in the wilderness, and possessed of a demeanor that is quiet, collected, and intimidating, you should play a shobhad.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefer untamed and open spaces over crowded cities or other heavily populated areas.</li>\n<li>Excel at hobbies that keep your hands occupied, such as carving, knitting, or sculpting.</li>\n<li>Take pride in the care and upkeep of your equipment and personal possessions, scorning those who don't respect their own possessions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Treat you with uneasy respect, having heard wild rumors of your people's warlike nature.</li>\n<li>Value you as a guide or protector, appreciating your great strength and keen insight.</li>\n<li>Mistake your quiet nature and implacable mien for scornfulness or arrogance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Shobhads have an impressive physical stature, standing between 10 and 12 feet tall with a muscular build. Their skin includes a range of colors from dusty gray, vibrant green, and faded turquoise. They have four powerful arms, which they which they use to wield a variety of weapons that would typically be too large or cumbersome for other species, multi-armed or otherwise. Shobhads are hairless and have pronounced, tusk-like canines in their lower jaw.</p>\n<p>Shobhad-neh on Akiton typically go lightly clothed, preferring equipment harnesses and practical clothing that allows them to strike a balance between ease of movement during their long journeys and protection from Akiton's harsh conditions. They're naturally inured to Akiton's biting cold and thus give little consideration in their dress when it comes to the cold. Typically, only religious leaders wear notably ornate clothing.</p>\n<p>Fondness for practicality doesn't equate with plainness, though. Shobhads appreciate artistry but frown upon frivolity and consider material excess a sign of foolishness, selfishness, and dishonor. Thus, shobhads</p>\n<p>enjoy practical art weapons, clothing, equipment, and other useful items crafted with care and lovingly decorated in ways that enhance (or at least don't impede) use. Shobhad crafters are known for their attention to detail, timeless designs, and understated artistic flourishes. Shobhad-neh favor hand-made objects and equipment over mass-produced equivalents, often handing beloved objects down through the generations. Shobhads practice a unique type of braidwork that their four hands are uniquely suited to. This braidwork often includes unique knots and weaves indicating a given shobhad's clan, home of origin, and other lineal details.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>On their home world of Akiton, shobhads live in nomadic clans, varying in size from a handful of hardy warriors to dozens of sprawling families, which range across Akiton's wild regions. Most follow traditional routes through their ancestral territory, moving with the seasons to avoid inclement weather, follow game, or harvest food. The slow encroachment of foreign civilization and the sudden incursion of raiders, thieves, and corporations upon their territory is a threat to the shobhad-neh way of life, which they take very seriously a threat often met with armed resistance. In fact, these foreign intrusions are one of the only surefire ways to unite rival shobhad clans together. In the face of outside threats, even millennia-long grudges and blood feuds are put aside shobhad-neh before shobhad.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, leadership of shobhad clans is divided into secular and religious responsibilities. Clan leaders, known as ne-jaks, handle issues like territory or property disputes, the choosing of scouts and campsites, rationing of resources, and other such affairs. Animistic religious leaders, called ne-tals, consult with spirits and perform auguries to provide guidance on clan unions, perform marriages, act as midwives, and conduct funeral rites.</p>\n<p>Typically, the responsibilities of ne-jaks and ne-tals do not overlap, though a clan's ne-tal can call for a vote among the elders of a clan to depose a ne-jak if they believe that the secular leader is guiding the clan down a dangerous or inappropriate path, or if age and infirmity are preventing the ne-jak from performing their duties adequately. Such action is rarely necessary since shobhad are taught from a young age to value the clan over the individual. This outlook means that few shobhads choose to permanently leave their clan without some major incident or event to drive them away. Banishment, disaster, inter-clan marriage, starvation, and war number among the most common instigating events, as does the destruction of a clan by outside forces. Shobhads who feel called to travel, adventure, or see the wider galaxy tend to work as scouts or traders, while those looking for a more permanent division tend to break away from their clan alongside a few other clanmates, splitting into a new clan. The relationship between clans and such splinter clans varies depending upon the reason for the split and the method by which it was achieved.</p>\n<p>Shobhads combine fierce independence with a deep reverence for their clan, people, and home world. They believe it's an individual's responsibility to give more to their community than they receive from it; this philosophy works well among their wandering nomadic clans but often makes individual shobhads uneasy in highly populated areas. In cities where food, water, transportation, and other necessities are readily available and often freely dispersed, it can be hard for a shobhad to understand how they can possibly contribute more than they are being given. This issue has led to many other species incorrectly believing that shobhads are antisocial or even opposed to concepts of civilization, though the truth is almost the opposite; some shobhads merely struggle with understanding how they can appropriately fit into a social structure that doesn't create opportunities for them to contribute in traditional ways.</p>\n<p>Shobhads tend to have a single personal name, two to three syllables in length and often hyphenated, relying upon braidwork to denote their clan affiliations, lineage, and other ties. They favor harsh sounds that remain easily distinguishable when shouted over long distances.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aruk, Bo-Shek, Do-Jat, Jah-Tor, Katso, Naz-Er, Samdak, Tan-Takneh, Virek-Nol, Zaren-Ka</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Shobhad religious beliefs are primarily animistic, with a faith in spirits and apparitions that embody a wide variety of concepts, creatures, and locations. Traditional Akitonian shobhads believe that even planets have a soul and that success in life comes from understanding and embodying that essence. The planet Akiton, they say, has a quiet and unforgiving soul that demands a quiet and unforgiving people, though most shobhads know better than to take this philosophy to an extreme that would alienate them from their people or from necessary allies. While shobhad-neh have mystics who excel at communicating with the many and varied spirits of different locales and planets, most shobhads pay at least a small showing of respect when entering a new region or visiting a religious site, believing that disrespecting any spirit (no matter how small, insignificant, strange, or foreign) can lead to lasting misfortune.</p>\n<p>Their respect for spirits is also an element of their preference for the longrifle. While shobhads do not shy from meeting an enemy in combat, there is a cultural misgiving related to killing an enemy who can see you with a ranged weapon. Tied to ancient views on honor and their spiritual nature, many shobhad believe, or at least worry, that the spirit of an opponent killed unfairly might follow them and bring bad luck. Thus, the shobhad longrifle is a weapon with exceptional range and accuracy capable of ending a life before their prey or foe can ever get a clear look at the sniper's face. Though some might view this as pure superstition, the existence of the spirits shobhad-neh revere can be seen in the magic of their religious leaders, and the skill and longevity of their snipers is a revered tradition across the Pact Worlds, which hints at a grain of empirical truth to the idea.</p>\n<p>In addition to their traditional beliefs, many modern shobhads choose to worship gods, with Weydan a notable favorite. Those shobhads who live in large urban centers, were not raised in a clan, or have left behind their traditional way of life display a wider diversity in religions, favoring Besmara, Damoritosh, the Devourer, Elotiru, Ibra, Lao Shu Po, or even Zon-Shelyn.</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Edicts</strong></h4>\n<p>master the skills necessary for survival so that you do not become a burden to others, show reverence for the world that gave you life</p>\n<h4><strong>Popular Anathema</strong></h4>\n<p>disrespect Akiton or another planet you call home through exploitative abuse of its resources, take more than you give to a community</p>\n<h2>Shobhad Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Large</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 Feet</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Strength, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Akitonian, Common, Shobhad</p>\n<p><strong>Additional languages</strong> One regional language of your choice.

          "text": "<p>Originally from Lajok, a frigid world orbiting a dying sun, vlakas became stellar nomads to survive. Now, Lajok's sun has miraculously rekindled, sparking strange solar powers within vlakas born under its light.</p>\n<p>Vlakas have a reputation for being contemplative, even-tempered, and understanding. Despite long ages spent watching the inevitable death of their world, they keep a positive outlook and an open mind. Though not self-sacrificing, they're willing to go to great lengths to help their family, friends, and colleagues, and they tend to emphasize the well- being of the group over that of the individual.</p>\n<p>While all vlakas share a keen sense of smell and touch, their other senses vary wildly. Deaf, blind, and deafblind vlakas are all born frequently. Vlakas are good at reading emotions and social cues, and they find it easy to make friends with others.</p>\n<p>If you want to play an open-minded and well-intentioned traveler who strives to do good throughout the galaxy, you should play a vlaka.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify people and their emotions by scent.</li>\n<li>Listen more than speak.</li>\n<li>Go out of your way to help others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Depend on you for guidance and mediation.</li>\n<li>Assume you'll agree to help them whenever they ask.</li>\n<li>Try to exploit your kindness, generosity, or helpfulness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Vlakas look similar to bipedal wolves, from their bushy, wagging tail to their canine snout and teeth. They have thick fur that keeps them warm in the arctic climate of their home world Lajok, which serves them just as well in the cool starship corridors that many nomadic vlakas call home. Their fur is usually white with large patches of pale blue, gray, or black. Many shed it after spending generations in warmer climates and grow a sleek summer coat that leans toward shades of white or cream with pale brown patches. Vlakas usually have blue, gray, or white eyes.</p>\n<p>Vlakas are tall and athletic, averaging between 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 feet tall and 175 to 250 lbs. The two senses that nearly all vlakas share are touch and an incredibly keen sense of smell. More than two thirds of all vlakas are born blind, deaf, or deafblind, with the remainder born hearing/sighted. Vlakas consider scent a crucial form of non-verbal communication and infuse smells into everything from everyday objects and locations to social interactions and entertainment.</p>\n<p>The strength and precision of a vlaka's sense of smell (and their ability to interpret olfactory inputs) varies between individuals. While most learn to identify familiar people and places by scent and can track a potent scent, the truly gifted can detect emotions by changes in pheromones and even sense their surroundings by smell.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Vlakas value the ability to listen, empathize, and understand. They consider impatience, jumping to conclusions, and selfishness all childish traits the acts of those who have yet to learn better. Likewise, they strongly frown upon being overly proud, boisterous, underhanded, greedy, or power hungry. Vlakas emphasize, but not always prioritize,the well-being of the group over that of the individual. They're charitable with their time and wealth, often going out of their way to aid others.</p>\n<p>Vlaka governments tend to uphold these same values, dutifully working for their community's benefit and faithfully advocating for the will of their constituents. Leadership is a duty akin to taking on a life of service, not a route to power or fame.</p>\n<p>Vlaka settlements tend to be concentric and formulaic. An outer ring of tall buildings or walls around the perimeter protects against the cold, wind, and bad weather as well as conserves heat. The innermost ring, where it's the most sheltered, is reserved for agriculture and public green spaces like parks. The rest of the city is divided into rings or wedges and arranged by area of interest or profession, such as entertainment, science, governance, or residential. Each district has a distinct scent and textured pavement, enabling vlakas from anywhere and with any array of senses to determine their general location within a city. When a district is full, the city tends to build down, rather than broach district boundaries.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Aeru, Alaza, Alelell, Aufenren, Bargai, Berilt, Berkal, Breyul, Carok, Daran, Delevana, Jikant, Jilavo, Kalvek, Kapleth, Lycos, Metzari, Parva, Poskari, Renvir, Ritta, Tarnat, Torrik, Vaudil, Wirath, Wirgara, Yormin</p>\n<h2>Beliefs</h2>\n<p>Traditional vlaka folktales and legends extol altruism, heroism, and charitable acts. They have no ancestral gods; instead, they traditionally live by the Cycle of death and rebirth, and many incorporate the Cycle into their beliefs. Otherwise, vlakas tend to worship gods who share their community-centered values, such as Hylax, Lambatuin, and Talavet. Nomadic vlakas often worship Weydan, while those who strive to save their planet or who wonder at Sota's rekindling favor gods who share their methodologies of choice, such as Ibra, Eloritu, or Yaraesa.

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your chosen connection. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your chosen connection or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Mystic Spells per Day), you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your chosen connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your chosen connection and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out epiphany spells or connection spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Mystic Feats <span style=\"float:right\">2nd</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a mystic class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">2nd</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your paradox. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your paradox. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank. You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Witchwarper Spells per Day on page 167), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your paradox and two other 2nd-rank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell. Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</h3>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out spells gained from your paradox. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">2nd</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Witchwarper Feats <span style=\"float:right\">2nd</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a witchwarper class feat.</p>\n<h2>Isolated Spell Matrix <span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.sf2e.class-features.Item.QslkWkHbHQEvWFCL inline hr=false]</p>\n<h3>Isolated Spell Matrix <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span></h3>\n<section class=\"traits\">\n<p>ANCHORING</p>\n<p>SPELLSHAPE</p>\n</section>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.E7HvICcH9CRAVzGc inline hr=false]</p>\n<h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>@Embed[Compendium.sf2e.class-features.Item.ml5oxO1iIxQZYdw4 inline hr=false]</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert. At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry in Chapter 2.</p>\n<h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h2>\n<p>Your awareness of possible dangers, through incredible analysis or an understanding of the wider multiverse, increases your reflexes. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h2>\n<p>Extended practice of magic has improved your capabilities.

Your chosen paradox determines your spellcasting tradition and grants you trained proficiency in the listed paradox skill. You automatically add your paradox spells to your spell repertoire, as described in the spell repertoire feature. You gain the initial warp spell at 1st level and can gain the advanced and greater warp spells by selecting the Advanced Warp and Greater Warp feats.

This increases to +2 at 10th level, and +3 at 16th level.</p>\n<h3>Skill Potency<span style=\"float:right\">3rd</span></h3>\n<p>At 3rd level, choose a single skill. You gain a +1 potency bonus with that skill. At 6th level, choose a second skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 9th level, choose one of those skills and increase its potency bonus to +2. At 13th level, increase the potency bonus of your second skill to +2 and choose a third skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 15th level, increase the third skill's potency bonus to +2 and choose a fourth skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. At 17th level, choose one of your three skills with a +2 potency bonus to increase to +3, and choose a fifth skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. Finally, at 20th level, choose one of the two skills with a +2 potency bonus to increase to +3, choose one of the three skills at a +1 potency bonus to increase to +2, and choose one new skill to gain a +1 potency bonus. You can spend 1 week to retrain one of these assignments at any time.</p>\n<h3>Devastating Attacks<span style=\"float:right\">4th</span></h3>\n<p>At 4th level, your weapon and unarmed Strikes deal two damage dice instead of one. This increases to three at 12th level and to four at 19th level.</p>\n<h3>Defense Potency<span style=\"float:right\">5th</span></h3>\n<p>At 5th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to AC. At 11th level, this bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level, to +3.</p>\n<h3>Perception Potency<span style=\"float:right\">7th</span></h3>\n<p>At 7th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to Perception, increasing to +2 at level 13 and +3 at level 19.</p>\n<h3>Saving Throw Potency<span style=\"float:right\">8th</span></h3>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain a +1 potency bonus to saves, increasing to +2 at level 14 and +3 at level 20.</p>\n<h3>Attribute Apex<span style=\"float:right\">17th</span></h3>\n<p>At 17th level, choose one attribute modifier to either increase by 1 or increase to +4 (whichever grants the higher modifer).</p>\n<h3>Adjusting Items and Treasure</h3>\n<p>With this variant, you can ignore as much of the Party Treasure by Level table on page 59 as you want, though you'll usually want to provide consistent currency. The main area your choice will impact is in spellcasting items, such as scrolls and wands. Remove all potency runes, striking runes, and resilient runes. Items that normally grant an item bonus to statistics or damage dice no longer do, other than the base item bonus to AC from armor. Apex items do not increase attribute modifiers.

You might restrict the free feats to those of a single archetype each character in the group has (for a shared backstory), those of archetypes fitting a certain theme (such as only ones from magical archetypes in a game set in a magic school), or entirely unrestricted if you just want a higher-powered game.</p>\n<p>If the group all has the same archetype or draws from a limited list, you might want to ignore the free archetype's normal restriction of selecting a certain number of feats before taking a new archetype. That way a character can still pursue another archetype that also fits their character.</p>\n<h3>Playing with Free Archetypes</h3>\n<p>Free-archetype characters are a bit more versatile and powerful than normal, but usually not so much that they unbalance your game. However, due to the characters' increased access to archetype feats, you should place a limit on the number of feats that scale based on a character's number of archetype feats (mainly multiclass Resiliency feats).

These are collectively a single set of attribute boosts, so a character can't boost the same attribute score more than once per set; players can put a dot next to each boosted attribute score or otherwise mark it to keep track. PCs also receive an attribute boost at 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th level (a second set); at 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th level (a third set); and at 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th level (the fourth and final set).</p>\n<p>This spreads out the attribute boosts, and using them earlier means a character can increase their most important attribute modifiers at a lower level.

          "text": "<p>This variant removes a character's level from their proficiency bonus, scaling it differently for a style of game that's outside the norm. This is a significant change to the system. The proficiency rank progression in Player Core is designed for science-fantasy games where heroes rise from humble origins to legendary strength. For some games, this narrative arc doesn't fit. Such games are about hedging bets in an uncertain and gritty world, in which even the world's best soldier can't guarantee a win against a large group of moderately skilled mercenaries.</p>\n<p>The initial implementation is fairly straightforward: the proficiency bonus just becomes +2 for trained, +4 for expert, +6 for master, and +8 for legendary. It's best to give an untrained character a –2 proficiency modifier instead of a +0 proficiency bonus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, for creatures, hazards, magic items, and so on, reduce each statistic that would include a proficiency bonus by the level of the creature or other rules element. These statistics are typically modifiers and DCs for attacks, ACs, saving throws, Perception, skills, and spells.</p>\n<p>Finally, decrease the skill DCs of most tasks. You can just subtract the level from the DC tables on page 53, or you can reference the Simple Skill DCs (No Level) table for a set of DCs that's easier to remember. The new DCs make it a little harder for high-level characters to succeed than it would be when using the default numbers, in keeping with the theme mentioned earlier. Combat outcomes will tend to flatten out, with critical successes and critical failures being less likely across the game. This is particularly notable in spells, where you're less likely to see the extreme effects of critical failures on saves.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\"><caption><strong>TABLE: SIMPLE SKILL DCS (NO LEVEL)</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Proficiency Rank</strong></th>\n<th><strong>DC</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Untrained</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trained</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expert</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Legendary</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Adjusting Encounters</h3>\n<p>Telling stories where a large group of low-level monsters can still be a significant threat to a high-level PC (and conversely, where a single higher-level monster is not much of a threat to a group of PCs) requires some significant shifts in encounter building, including shifts in the PCs' rewards.</p>\n<p>Under the default math, two monsters of a certain level are roughly as challenging as a single monster 2 levels higher. However, with level removed from proficiency, this assumption is no longer true. The XP budget for creatures uses a different scale, as shown in the Creature XP (No Level) table. You'll still use the same XP budget for a given threat level as shown on the @UUID[.WZgFEMDSP9TvYc4u]{Encounter Budget} (80 XP for a moderate-threat encounter, 120 for a severe-threat encounter, and so on).</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\"><caption><strong>TABLE: CREATURE XP (NO LEVEL)</strong></caption>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p><strong>Creature's Level</strong></p>\n</th>\n<th><strong>XP</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 7</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 6</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 5</td>\n<td>14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 4</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 3</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 2</td>\n<td>26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level - 1</td>\n<td>32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 1</td>\n<td>48</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 2</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 3</td>\n<td>72</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 4</td>\n<td>90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 5</td>\n<td>108</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 6</td>\n<td>135</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Party level + 7</td>\n<td>160</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>While the XP values in the Creature XP (No Level) table work well in most cases, sometimes they might not account for the effects of creatures' special abilities when facing a party of a drastically different level.

However, using this variant, PCs might defeat a creature 5 levels higher than they are, or even more! Too many encounters with higher-level foes can wind up giving the PCs more treasure than you expected, or vice versa if they're fighting weaker foes that put up more of a fight but still have poor treasure. You can make periodic adjustments if the PCs' treasure drifts too far from expectations. Making it so they can't easily sell or buy magic items will mean it's harder for them to exploit treasure they gain. To sidestep the issue entirely, you can use automatic bonus progression.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder GM Core pg. 85</em></span></p>"

PCs work together to discover and exploit a computer's vulnerabilities in order to help bypass the system's security without triggering its countermeasures. Using the hacking subsystem, characters who are untrained in Computers can help using magic, social skills, and more. There are two kinds of hacking encounters: simple and complex.</p>\n<p>Simple hacking is quick, streamlined, and functions like a simple hazard. Simple computers have one access point and no vulnerabilities. Hacking a simple computer or Disabling the computer's countermeasures is a two-action activity. If the PCs have the time to gain access to a simple computer without the pressure of an accompanying encounter, you can allow the PCs up to two additional failures before triggering the computer's countermeasures. Alternatively, you can use the guidelines for building a computer to introduce a custom vulnerability or otherwise modify a simple computer, but adding more than one vulnerability runs the risk of making it a complex encounter that takes much more time to hack!</p>\n<p>Complex hacking occurs over multiple rounds that might last a variable amount of time. During each round of a complex hacking encounter, each PC can act once, attempting to either exploit vulnerabilities, notice and disable countermeasures, or Hack one of the computer's points of access. Each time a character successfully exploits an access point's vulnerability, the DC to Hack the associated access point is lowered by the indicated value. If a character fails to Disable the access point's countermeasures or fails to Hack an access point, they accrue one failure (two on a critical failure) for that access point. Each access point has one or more countermeasures that trigger when a group accrues enough failures. Characters in the same group can act in whatever order they prefer, each taking a turn. Usually, the character attempting to Hack the computer will go last, giving the rest of the party an opportunity to disable the computer's countermeasures and lower the DC by exploiting vulnerabilities. While a group of hackers might be tempted to take their time and explore every avenue before attempting to Hack a computer, doing so is risky! During each round the PCs attempt to exploit one or more vulnerabilities, but don't attempt to Hack an access point or disable a countermeasure, they accrue one failure for an associated access point.</p>\n<h2>Building a Computer</h2>\n<p>Every hacker needs a computer to hack! The form a computer takes can vary greatly, from a secure technological database accessed via a holographic interface to an interdimensional tree that grows across realities and stores its data inside colorful, intangible fruits accessible only through lucid dreaming. While incredibly different and bound to sport unique vulnerabilities and countermeasures, both are computers for the purpose of the hacking subsystem.</p>\n<h3>Concept</h3>\n<p>The first step to building a computer is to develop an initial concept. What does accessing the computer allow your players to accomplish? What level is it? Is it simple or complex? Is it magical, technological, or hybrid? Does it have a virtual intelligence, or is it a living creature? Does it use remote access points, or does it require direct physical access? You should brainstorm the computer's name and description, as that can help you plan its vulnerabilities and countermeasures.</p>\n<h3>Computer Types</h3>\n<p>Most computers have the tech trait and can be hacked using skills like Computers, Crafting, and Thievery. Magic computers might incorporate programmable aeon stones or bound machine spirits that command ancient constructs and are usually Hacked using Arcana, Nature, Occultism, or Religion. Hybrid computers have the tech and magic traits, such as a password-protected spell chip or an arcane barrier controlled by a console. Hybrid computers often have different access points for their magical and technological components, but Hacking either should grant access to the computer. A computer's stat block will never be able to list every possible skill a character might use during a hacking encounter. You can use the values listed in a computer's stat block as a guideline to resolve creative, unlisted solutions to a hacking encounter.</p>\n<h3>Setting the Statistics</h3>\n<p>Use a hazard's Stealth and Disable DCs to determine the computer's DCs. Successfully exploiting vulnerabilities with a low DC should reduce the DC to Hack by 1, those with a high DC should reduce it by 2, and those with an elite DC by 3. Penalties to the Hacking DC incurred while exploiting a vulnerability are cumulative and should never be enough to reduce the DC below the low DC. The DC to notice a countermeasure is usually lower than the DC to disable it, which is always high or elite.</p>\n<h3>Simplified Quick Hacking</h3>\n<p>For a simplified quick hacking encounter, you can ask each of your players to roll appropriate skill checks to support the character(s) attempting the Hacking check. Each successful skill check lowers the Hacking DC by 1, or 2 on a critical success; a critical failure raises the Hacking DC by 1 instead.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder GM Core pg. 222-223</em></span></p>"

          "name": "Cinematic Starship Scenes",
          "text": "<h1>Running Cinematic Starship Scenes</h1>\n<p>A cinematic starship scene runs like most encounters, with players rolling initiative for their characters based on how their characters entered the scene and taking individual turns in that order during each round. Prior to the start of a cinematic starship scene, each player selects one of the starship roles their character occupies, which determines the skill they roll for initiative. Someone acting as a pilot is likely to roll Piloting for initiative, while a science officer might roll Computers or Perception. Remember that each PC might receive a bonus to their rolls based on the Starship Bonuses available!</p>\n<p>At the beginning of a round, each starship role becomes available, as determined by the scene. At the start of a PC's turn, they select an available role to occupy, maintaining that role until the beginning of the next round. This means a PC who acted as pilot in the previous round could act as captain in the following round, as long as the role is currently available and unoccupied. Some roles can be occupied by multiple PCs, such as a ship that has two gunners or even two science officers. The available roles and the number of characters who can occupy each role are noted in the scene.</p>\n<p>Based on the role a PC selects, they have one or more special actions they can use on their turn. This might represent a special piloting maneuver to try to escape the threat, a counterhacking endeavor the science officer might need to commit to, a magical ritual necessary to close a nearby rift into Hell, or even a simple firing of the ship's laser cannon at a foe! As usual, PCs have 3 actions during their turn, which they'll use to perform special actions granted by their role or other actions of their choice. As most starship actions require 2 actions to use, each PC is likely to have a single action to spare on their turn, which might include a PC preparing to Aid an ally, a spellcaster casting guidance to improve their odds of success on a skill check, or a PC taking a shot at an enemy boarder invading the bridge.</p>\n<p>Unlike the PCs onboard their starship, who are the stars of the show and guide the story with their choices, the threats in a cinematic starship scene operate using preset routines—though some scenes might provide variations on a routine to keep the PCs on their toes! Enemy starships involved in the scene perform routines and don't perform crew actions.</p>\n<h2>Cinematic Starship Scene XP</h2>\n<p>Characters gain Experience Points (XP) for encountering a cinematic starship scene, whether they succeed or not. The scene's level indicates what level of party the scene is a good challenge for. The XP values for a cinematic starship scene are equal to the XP for a monster or complex hazard of the same level. To best challenge your players, you should aim to design scenes that range in difficulty from the party's level – 1 to the party's level + 1. Scenes of a lower level than the party's level – 4 are beyond trivial and award no XP.</p>\n<p>You can also grant the PCs additional XP as a story award for succeeding at a scene's victory conditions, doubling the Victory Points threshold for a victory condition, completing additional objectives, achieving an important story milestone, or even coming up with creative solutions.</p>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"pf2e remaster\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<p>Level</p>\n</th>\n<th>\n<p>XP</p>\n</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level – 4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>10 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level – 3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>15 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level – 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>20 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level – 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>30 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>40 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level + 1</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>60 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level + 2</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>80 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level + 3</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>100 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Party level + 4</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>120 XP</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>\n<p>There are a few situations that might occur in cinematic starship scenes that are different from normal encounters.</p>\n<p><strong>Balancing for More Crew:</strong> Most encounters, including those in printed adventures, assume a baseline number of four PCs acting onboard a starship. Sometimes a scene might include a friendly NPC and their presence is balanced for in the encounter. When accounting for additional PCs beyond four, it's important to look at the number of successes required for any associated Victory Points system at play as well as the potential output of enemy starships. Generally, the number of gunners available on the PCs' starship accounts for damage output, so adding more PCs won't necessarily increase damage output, but instead provide the PCs with more options on how to complete the encounter or better their chances with other checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Character Abilities:</strong> Some characters might have special abilities, such as feats or spells, they can use during a cinematic starship scene. Core class abilities, like Aim for an operative or Suppressing Fire for a soldier, aren't intended for cinematic starship scenes. Most applications for feats and spells are left up to the GM's discretion for what's appropriate to the specific encounter but generally should veer on the more permissive side when it makes sense. Spells might be usable on a PC's turn, with some single-action enhancement spells like guidance fitting exceptionally well into the action economy a character receives during their turn. Similarly, a GM might provide a bonus or reward for casting particularly powerful spells, like phantasmal fleet, instead of taking a bespoke starship action on their turn. Remember, the goal is for every player to have fun playing the characters they created.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditions on Starships:</strong> Sometimes, the PCs' starship might gain a condition or similar negative effect that has a timing element. In most cases, these conditions last for a specified duration; however, persistent damage requires a slight adjustment as it shouldn't trigger on each player's turn, as the damage affects the starship and not the PCs. Instead, resolve persistent damage on a starship at the end of each round, having one PC roll the flat check to recover. A PC occupying the engineer role can spend 2 actions on their turn to perform Assisted Recovery on their starship, reducing the flat check's DC to 10. This allows the engineer to attempt an extra flat check to end the persistent damage immediately, but only once per round. This is a replacement for the normal Assisted Recovery rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Weapon Ranges:</strong> For simplicity of running these encounters, there are no range increments for starship attacks in cinematic starship scenes. This keeps things simple and avoids the need for the encounter to have a tactical map. There might be a special action that allows a pilot to line up a better shot or move the starship further out of range to make hitting it more difficult. When accounting for the effects of character actions, such as spells, the distance between starships is up to the GM's discretion but generally should be assumed to be at least several hundred feet apart unless the pilot takes a special action to safely maneuver close to the other starship.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder GM Core pg. 226-227</em></span></p>"

On a Large or Huge mount, you can attack any square adjacent to the mount if you have 5- or 10-foot reach, or any square within 10 feet of the mount (including diagonally) if you have 15-foot reach. Use the adjusted reach for determining flanking and other rules that depend on reach.</p>\n<h3>Mounted Defenses</h3>\n<p>Attackers can target either you or your mount. An area effect affects both of you as long as you're both in the area. You're in an attacker's reach or range if any square of your mount is within reach or range. Because your mount is larger than you and you share its space, you have lesser cover against attacks targeting you when you're mounted if the mount would be in the way (as determined by the GM).</p>\n<p>Because you can't move your body as freely while you're riding a mount, you take a –2 circumstance penalty to Reflex saves while mounted. Additionally, the only move action you can use is the Mount action to dismount.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.other-effects.Item.9c93NfZpENofiGUp]{Effect: Mounted}</p>\n<h2>Aerial Combat</h2>\n<p>Many monsters can fly, and PCs can use spells and items to gain the ability to fly. Flying creatures have to use the Fly action to move through the air. Performing an especially tricky maneuver might require using Acrobatics to Maneuver in Flight. Creatures might fall from the sky, using the falling rules found on page 421. At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work in the air. For instance, a flying creature couldn't @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.actions.Item.d5I6018Mci2SWokk]{Leap}.</p>\n<h2>Aquatic Combat</h2>\n<p>Use these rules for battles in water or underwater:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You're @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} unless you have a swim Speed.</li>\n<li>You gain resistance 5 to acid and fire.</li>\n<li>You take a –2 circumstance penalty to your attack roll for bludgeoning or slashing attacks that pass through water.</li>\n<li>Ranged attacks made by an underwater creature or against an underwater target have their range increments halved.</li>\n<li>You can't cast fire spells or use actions with the fire trait underwater. As normal for how traits work, any part of the effect that's unrelated to fire still works. For example, an attack with a flaming battleaxe could still deal its physical damage, just not its fire damage.</li>\n<li>At the GM's discretion, some ground-based actions might not work underwater or while floating.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.other-effects.Item.TPbr1kErAAJKBi3V]{Effect: Aquatic Combat}</p>\n<h3>Drowning and Suffocating</h3>\n<p>You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier. Reduce your remaining air by 1 round at the end of each of your turns, or by 2 if you attacked or cast any spells that turn. You also lose 1 round worth of air each time you are critically hit or critically fail a save against a damaging effect. If you speak (including Casting a Spell) you lose all remaining air.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.sf2e.other-effects.Item.2u26bmArDPuoCljc]{Effect: Remaining Air}</p>\n<p>When you run out of air, you fall @UUID[Compendium.sf2e.conditions.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and start suffocating. You can't recover from being unconscious and must attempt a DC 20 @Check[fortitude] save at the end of each of your turns. On a failure, you take @Damage[1d10[untyped]] damage, and on a critical failure, you die. On each check after the first, the DC increases by 5 and the damage by 1d10; these increases are cumulative. Once your access to air is restored, you stop suffocating and are no longer unconscious (unless you're at 0 Hit Points).</p>\n<p><em>Section: Playing the Game</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder Player Core pg. 429</em></span></p>"

Sometimes, though, a character is the embodiment of their ancestry to the point that it's of equal importance to their class.

However, sometimes the use of Hero Points can become underwhelming when the reroll result is worse than the initial result—it might even feel worse if the reroll result is the same result as the original roll! This simple variant rule is intended to make Hero Points more of a heroic resource in your campaign, allowing you to reroll low results into something better. Using this rule will increase the overall power of Hero Points and, like some other variant rules, is something you'll want to heavily consider the ramifications of before including in your game.</p>\n<h2>Heroic Rerolls</h2>\n<p>When using this variant rule to reroll a d20 result using a Hero Point, if the result on the dice is less than a 10, increase the dice result to become a 10.

          "text": "<p>Skill feats allow characters to gain thematic feats that can help them in exploration, downtime, and social interactions. But given the high stakes of encounter mode, many players feel pressured to select skill feats that improve their efficacy in combat at the expense of selecting feats that better represent their character's abilities. This can be especially frustrating if a character wants to specialize in a skill like Diplomacy or Piloting that includes skill feats that might only see use in one or two sessions.</p>\n<h2>Building a Skill Paragon character</h2>\n<p>When creating a skill paragon character, after selecting the character's class, choose a specific skill. The character becomes trained in it. If they were already trained in it, they become trained in another skill instead of their chosen skill. At 3rd, 7th, and 15th levels, they gain an additional skill increase they can apply only to their chosen skill. They automatically gain all common general skill feats that specifically requires proficiency in the chosen skill as a prerequisite as soon as they qualify for those feats. If they already gain one of those feats (such as from a background or heritage), they instead gain Assurance for the chosen skill or, if they already have Assurance for that skill, a related Lore skill.</p>\n<p>Not all skills have the same number of feats, and some skill choices will end up granting more bonus feats than others. Characters with two or more fewer bonus Skill Paragon feats than any other character in the party gain their choice of the Additional Lore skill feat in a category related to their chosen skill, or the Assurance, Automatic Knowledge, or Experienced Professional skill feat in their chosen skill or a related Lore skill.</p>\n<h2>Campaign Specific Skills</h2>\n<p>You can limit the skills characters can select based on the nature of the campaign. For example, in a campaign where characters play as crew members of a starship, you can designate specific roles on the ship that use specific skills, like captain (Diplomacy), doctor (Medicine), engineer (Crafting), and pilot (Piloting). You can delay the benefits of the variant rule until after campaign roles are formally assigned, especially when using the variant rules in tandem with the Level 0 Character rules.</p>\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder GM Core pg. 87</em></span></p>"

Sometimes, it can be a lot of fun to play a prequel game set years before the PCs' first adventure as heroes, or you might have an idea for a low-powered adventure. The rules below provide ways to build and use level 0 PCs.</p>\n<h2>Building Characters</h2>\n<p>Building a level 0 character is similar to building a 1st-level character, but you stop after choosing your ancestry and background. A level 0 character still gets the four free attribute boosts from Step 6 of the normal character creation process, but not the class attribute boost.</p>\n<h3>Initial Proficiencies</h3>\n<p>A level 0 character is trained in Perception, all saving throws, unarmed attacks, unarmored defense, and one simple weapon of their choice. Additionally, they're trained in a number of skills equal to 2 + their Intelligence modifier. The proficiency bonus for a level 0 character works the same way as normal, but since the level is 0, the total proficiency bonus for being trained is +2.</p>\n<h3>Hit Points</h3>\n<p>A level 0 character adds their Constitution modifier to their ancestry Hit Points to determine their starting Hit Points.</p>\n<h3>Starting Money</h3>\n<p>A level 0 character starts with 50 credits for equipment.</p>\n<h3>Apprentice Option</h3>\n<p>If the story you want to tell is about characters who have started training to become a particular class, you can grant them a small number of additional abilities. An apprentice character is trained in the skill or skills specified for their chosen class (such as Athletics and Intimidation for a soldier) in addition to the skills they gain through their initial proficiencies. They also gain benefits based on the class.</p>\n<p><strong>Solarian:</strong> An apprentice solarian gains a solar flare, solar nimbus, or solar weapon (but not all three). They can only select one trait for their solar weapon and don't gain attunement, so they don't gain the additional benefits of being attuned.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Martial Class:</strong> An apprentice of another martial class (envoy, operative, and soldier, for example) is trained in light armor, all simple weapons, and one martial weapon listed in the class's initial proficiencies. If a martial class not listed here lacks light armor or martial weapon training, give it a different ability as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellcaster:</strong> An apprentice spellcaster is trained in the appropriate magic tradition and gains two cantrips from their class. A prepared caster can't change these cantrips each day.</p>\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n<p>Combat can be especially dangerous for level 0 characters. For safety's sake, you might treat the characters as level –1 when determining what combat encounters are appropriate. For skill checks, they can still accomplish tasks with a simple trained DC using their trained skills, but success is less certain. Since they have fewer skills, the party might not have anyone trained for a given task. If you're playing these characters for more than a few sessions, consider advancing them to 1st level using the fast advancement speed (800 XP). If your group wants a longer experience at level 0, start the group without the apprentice benefits, then level up to apprentice (gaining those benefits and the apprentice adjustments for their class), and then level up to 1st level.</p>\n<h2>Treasure</h2>\n<p>As the characters start with 50 credits, their adventures up to 1st level should account for the rest of a 1st-level character's starting money. That means you'll distribute treasure worth 100 credits × the number of PCs, a large percentage of which should be in credits.\n<p><em>Section: Subsystem and Variant Rules</em><span style=\"float:right\"><em>Starfinder GM Core pg. 84</em></span></p>"
