While in this state, the PCs function mostly normally, but appear as semi-solid ectoplasmic versions of themselves. They aren't quite transparent, but their solid bodies seem to waver and shimmer along the edges, giving them an eerie, unsettling appearance. While in this state, they're living creatures but gain some of the following abilities similar to those shared by undead creatures. As living creatures more akin to phantoms, they remain susceptible to negative damage and are healed by positive energy.</p>\n<p><strong>Undead Vision:</strong> They gain low-light vision, or darkvision if their ancestry already has low-light vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Transmigrated Survival:</strong> A PC in this state never gains the wounded condition, but instead becomes exposed to soul degradation upon recovering from the dying condition (see below).

When the PCs manifest their transmigrated bodies in the living world, they each gain two minor spirit powers and one major spirit power from the spirit powers listed below. Every time the PCs do their daily preparations, they can reselect their chosen spirit powers. When a spirit power calls for a saving throw, use the higher of that PC's class DC or spell DC. Any spirit powers calling for attack rolls use this DC – 10. Use the PC's own level for determining the effects of any counteract checks.</p>\n<p><strong>Soul Degradation:</strong> Initially, PCs will likely revel in their newfound spirit powers. Whenever a transmigrated PC comes close to death, however, they risk losing themselves entirely to their ghostly nature. Each time a dying transmigrated PC would normally gain the wounded condition, they're instead exposed to soul degradation and must attempt a new saving throw to resist increasing the stage of this curse.</p>\n<h3>Minor Spirit Powers</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.VMpc8QWEZxSH8Mr4]{Curiosity}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.fsxCcyWpag5iuWOU]{Delusion}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.ekiKKfsBDFEeVmun]{Duty}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.w4t0ElpqNQRFCaPJ]{Love}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.g6iKvH7Y3InQtZ8K]{Obsession}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.w1nzN61S6NfkDH7Y]{Passion}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.YdG3UwVBia5AyLjO]{Spite}</p>\n<h3>Major Spirit Powers</h3>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.DVILYNQVB2hx9Chl]{Chilling Paralysis}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.pHXGTgjwWY3OBRF2]{Dematerialize}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.0HChyDaXdpXN11q4]{Flickering Figure}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.SnIvcCNASDzgevQK]{Flight}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.3yYlHV7GBrafsDwE]{Grudge}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.KtqDsKBuOmCkbDcR]{Resist Death}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.KbQXDTBi5MKtHbpU]{River's Reflection}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.sjLNgLFyDvTt6VVV]{Sap Life}</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.adventure-specific-actions.Item.UnQ8oHYc0dBJHZv9]{Undying Flesh}</p>",

      "description": "<p>Celebrities, including famous adventurers like your PCs, don't always present themselves to the public in a way that accurately reflects who they are. In Curtain Call, each PC will select a persona trait. Regardless of your character's personality, motives, and goals, the public's perception of their legend may be quite different as a result of rumors, misinterpreted events, fanciful imaginings, or even deliberate attempts by a character to foster a different persona.</p>\n<p>There are eight persona traits you can choose from for your PC. The trait you adopt doesn't have to match your character's actual personality or role, but if you pick one that's off the mark, be prepared for NPCs you encounter to make some curious assumptions about your character! Note that while each persona trait has a positive and negative aspect to it, both of these elements are strictly narrative and have no mechanical effects on your character's abilities. Think of them as roleplaying tools that you can use to help guide your PC's actions during the campaign. These traits do, however, have an impact on the adventures: in certain parts of Curtain Call, characters with specific persona traits will be particularly well-suited to face certain challenges and will gain one-time boons and bonuses that help them navigate the encounter in question. Your GM has all of this information and will inform the party whenever persona traits come into play.</p>\n<p>The eight persona traits are:</p>\n<p><strong>Flirt</strong>: The public perceives you as the most romantic of the group, and you may be thought of as a seducer or vapid pretender who gets by on their looks and brings nothing of value to the party.</p>\n<p><strong>Guardian</strong>: The public perceives you as the healer and protector of the group, but some may also consider you too soft-hearted and meek to be a \"true hero.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Leader</strong>: The public perceives you as the leader of the group, but some likewise consider you too brash or even pompous.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholar</strong>: The public considers you the problem-solver and brains of the group, though some also perceive you as arrogant or incapable of physical tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoundrel</strong>: The public is convinced you are the \"bad boy/bad girl\" of the group who gets the distasteful but necessary things done, but who is at times thought of as a criminal or potential traitor to the party.</p>\n<p><strong>Underdog</strong>: The public perceives you as a \"fish out of water\"—someone who accidently got swept up by the group and still manages to triumph, but who is sometimes thought of as a weak link or loser.</p>\n<p><strong>Warrior</strong>: The public believes you are the strong-arm of the group, the person who excels in a fight but is also at times considered cruel, uncouth, or even a bully.</p>\n<p><strong>Wildcard</strong>: The public perceives you as a source of whimsy, outlandish ideas, and comedy in the group, but that reputation is a double-edged sword, as some also consider you a liability or unreliable.</p>"
