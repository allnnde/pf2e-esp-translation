Instead, a credstick is a safe and anonymous means of moving credits around without being traced.

Sometimes a person might carry several credsticks, dedicating each one to a different use, or simply trading the stick away if they want to make a purchase of a predefined amount. If ever the number of credsticks on a person becomes too cumbersome, it's easy enough to move the funds between individual sticks and discard emptied sticks to save on space, however a credstick always has a negligible bulk.</p>"
