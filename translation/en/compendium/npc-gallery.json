Generally found on the coast, azarketis favor life near a major body of water, as keeping their skin hydrated is a biological requirement. Though most azarketis live relatively peaceful lives of fishing or farming, they sometimes need to defend their homes against hostile forces, and some leave their communities to become adventurers. The following statistics may be used to represent commonly encountered azarketis.</p>\n<p>Azarketis with more adventurous spirits often learn the art of sailing and join the crew of a ship. Such sailors get to enjoy their time above deck while also having near-constant access to large bodies of water. Ship captains also appreciate having azarketis on board, as they're able to easily scrape barnacles off the hull, check the rudder, and help patch any leaks. Though they have a talent for swimming more than sailing, they've earned a reputation as lucky to have on board.</p>",

While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.</p>\n<p>Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error.

Within the order, the word of these figures is law, and members from the lowliest squire to the most senior knight follow commands from a paravicar with unswerving devotion. Paravicars see their personal dedication to the order's edicts as an example for all members and hold themselves to the same high standards as their underlings. Though they seldom need to call upon them, paravicars use their considerable infernal powers to reinforce their positions in the Hellknight's hierarchy.</p>\n<p>In combat, paravicars take direct command of their troops of knights and armigers. Paravicars are experienced campaigners who prefer calculated tactical gambits to hot-headed, risky maneuvers that could leave their forces exposed. If pressed into combat, paravicars use their abilities to demoralize their foes and compel enemies to become their allies or to flee the field.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order.

Privateers work for their own profit and reputation, of course, but they also commit themselves to keeping the sea-lanes free from navies that strive to enforce land law on the unbounded waves. Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo. Generally, however, the privateer captain is willing to spare prisoners so that they might be ransomed and spread tales of Firebrands' actions across the region.</p>\n<p>The privateer captain is often at the vanguard of boarding parties. Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Wherever oppression or an opportunity for daring adventure can be found, the Firebrands can be found chasing after. PCs might find the Firebrands to be allies in a quest for righteous rebellion or justice against slavery, or they might find these dashing daredevils to be friendly-or not so friendly-rivals for the same treasure. The charming scoundrel presented here could easily be a low level freedom fighter or foil for the PCs, or might serve as crew for the privateer captain. The privateer captain can serve as a transport willing to take the PCs to the most dangerous locations, an intermittent ally that provides a timely rescue when least expected, a competing explorer, or a powerful and deadly enemy.</p>",

The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse.
