      "description": "<p>No one knows where and when Aakriti came into existence. Some divine scholars surmise they've always been a part of the primordial soup of creation. The most popular theory, as reflected in various religious iconography, is that Aakriti is the pupae of a primordial deity that took damage in their chrysalis state and became unable to molt into their final form.</p>\n<p>Known as Aakriti the Evershifting, this ooze deity represents the ever-evolving nature of creation and life as well the potential of the unknown. New life crawls forth from their primordial depths in an explosion of the bizarre and colorful, adjusting in their own individual ways to the challenges of existence. As each life moves through the various cycles of growth over time, they must be flexible and adapt to the changes, especially at its crux—the state of transition. Sometimes a new step involves a frightening destruction of identity, but it should be embraced instead of feared, as the primordial nothingness holds the potential for new creations beyond the wildest imaginings of one's current self. Those who stay rigid in their beliefs or refuse to change will become trapped in the shells of their old selves and crush themselves in their struggle to avoid growth. Aakriti also has no love for those who entrap creatures into a form unwillingly and will sometimes intercede against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Evershifting</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Discovery, life, ooze, potential</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Create without reservation, help others unlock their true potential, observe the mysteries of life</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Fail to study a new creature if safely able, force a creature to live in the wrong body, reject creatures or information due to bigoted or rigid beliefs</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> molting cicada</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> insect</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> all</p>"

She used her magic to move Golarion's moon in the way of the incoming meteor, absorbing most of the destructive blast. Her body fell from the sky and plunged into the planet's core.

He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities. Even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly attempts to coax Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties, barely warrants acknowledgment from the mantis god.

Such a war would sweep across Golarion like a massive wildfire. Until that time, Apsu entreats mortal artists and leaders to make the world the best place it can possibly be.

She so impressed the god Aroden that, after her untimely death, he elevated her to be his herald, the Red Crusader, and she continued to fight for humanity. Yet in 3823 ar, the Knights of Ozem fatefully chose to bind her to their will as they rallied against the Whispering Tyrant. Despite her heroism in leading the charge, the Whispering Tyrant prevailed, and he took particular delight in capturing, humiliating, torturing, and finally killing her. Although the Knights of Ozem recovered her body, they—and Aroden—failed her again when the necromancer Geb had her body stolen and then reanimated against her will, turning her into a lich. In thrall to Geb for over a thousand years, she ruled his nation, all the while suffering torments that changed her profoundly. She endured all of them.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, Arazni decided to risk allying with mortals once again and, with their help, succeeded in tricking the Whispering Tyrant into destroying the magic that bound her to lichdom and to Geb. During her time on Geb's throne, she had been worshipped as a god, though few of the Gebbite masses who paid her obeisance were sincere. Arazni dismissed most of her true believers as sycophants, but for those trapped by unwilling bonds and other believers beyond Geb's borders, Arazni was a paragon of resilience and determination that reflected their own fierce struggles. Perhaps owing to their devotion, ending her lichdom didn't end her.

The shield is the symbol of protection: caring for others is something that occurs at all times, not just during conflict. A follower can help others by offering services and kindness to their community.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The War Children</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Childbirth, protection, warfare</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Aid in the rearing of children; prepare your body, mind, and community for eventual conflict; support your community</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Engage in mindless war, refuse to answer a genuine plea for protection</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> two coatls consuming each other’s tails with their wings overlapping in the center</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> armadillo</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> gold</p>"

As Embaral sent gentle waves onto the shores adjoining his waters to better understand them, the goddess Vudravati was drawn to his persistence and patience, and the two fell in love.</p>\n<p>But Vudravati also loved Embaral's twin, Obari. While the goddess was happy to take both as lovers, the jealous brothers soon went to war with each other for her affections. Obari sent typhoons to stir chaos in Embaral's waters, while Embaral stilled the winds raised by his brother and flooded the distant lands that Obari loved. The other ocean gods attempted to intervene to disastrous effect, with many losing their lives and immortality in the ensuing battles. As the war spilled across borders and waves, other gods of sea and storm abandoned their traditional demesnes to help shield mortals from the effects of the brothers' wrath. They created bays and seas, coordinating with gods of earth and stone to form peninsulas and islands, anything that the immortal powers could arrange to curtail the brother's influence and stay the fallout of their wrath. A few gods and immortal beings of the great waters fled Golarion altogether, seeking worlds and dominions that were not active battlegrounds for potent and violent immortal forces. But even when Embaral and Obari fought alone in isolated segments of Golarion's oceans, their war for dominance raged unabated, neither willing to be the first to retreat nor willing to sacrifice their emotional claims. Only Vudravati was able to stop the brothers' war, physically separating Embaral and Obari by lying between them in an endless sleep.

The order was founded in 3988 AR when the gentleman-explorer Aldus Canter returned from the Osirian desert where he had been lost for 3 years. Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened.

They turn to Adanye, the catfolk deity who embodies the warmth of the hearth, and to Mazludeh, known as the Mother of Hearth and Wall, for protection and support of family and community. They look to Erastil, that well-known and widely worshipped god of nature, provisioning, home, and community, for aid in the harvest and the hunt. Because their lives are so closely tied to the seasons as much as the home, they look to the powerful Uvuko for comfort and assistance through all such changes. There is little by way of formal worship for this pantheon: its adherents intone a prayer over their morning duties or enact a ritual before a hunt, so worship is usually a daily practice with little fanfare.

The fundamental principle behind the Laws is a relatively simple assertion that deific aid-even the best intentioned-ultimately comes at too high a price. The slaughter of fellow mortals for the glory of distant, unfathomable beings is not something that should be permitted within a society. Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> mortal affairs, peace, self-rule</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> challenge religious power and the spread of religion, expose and eradicate hidden worship, provide a peaceful and autonomous society in which the people are cared for through social infrastructure</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> worship or swear an oath by a deity or religion, solicit or receive divine or religious aid, take a side in conflicts between religions</p>"

Minderhal even went as far as encouraging the stone giants to accept being enslaved by the Thassilonians in exchange for political and magical might for himself, citing that it was only natural for the strong to subjugate the weak. Unsurprisingly, the moment the Thassilonian empire crumbled, so did faith in him.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> He Who Makes and Unmakes</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Creation, giants, justice, strength</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Strictly follow established tradition, conquer the weak, obey those in power</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Break tradition, question those with greater positional power, provide succor to those who have turned their backs on Minderhal</p>"

Instead, scholars study and plot aeons' actions, striving to discern the Monad's ultimate goal or to uncover universal truths they can exploit for their own purposes.

Still, he wishes them to know the joy of love, to experience how the power of laughter can bond them with others regardless of station, and to hold their sorrows at bay for just a moment more. He wants them to know that there's no shame in learning a lesson borne from failure, but rather great pride in true humility and in being able to work past the ego to instead find humor in all the silly stages of life.</p>\n<p>A common saying is that \"a Ragdyan tries anything at least once, and gladly tells you the story of how it went wrong at least twice.\" For his many rural followers, being a Ragdyan means being open to expanding their horizons when the chance arrives, even if they're unable to go out and adventure themselves.

Once initiated into Razmir's church, priests are taught the steps in careful and controlled increments; the highest ranking of Razmir's priests are the gold-masked Visions of the 15th Step, and the second-highest rank are the silver-masked Masks of the 12th Step. What the remaining sixteen steps between the Visions and Razmir might be are known only to Razmir and the Visions themselves, though no Vision has yet attained the wisdom and discipline to ascend beyond the 15th Step.</p>\n<p>In the days before he brought peace and prosperity to the people of the River Kingdoms, Razmir ascended to godhood in the year 4661 ar, by following the path of the 31 Steps and completing the Test of the Starstone. Following his ascension, Razmir made his way to the Archduchy of Melcat, where his feats of incredible magic power, promises of wealth, and teachings regarding the secret to following in his footsteps caused many to flock to his banner and holy word. Razmir founded his first temple in the Melcatian city of Xer, where he began elevating masked priests to serve him and teaching the doctrine of the 31 Steps. Razmir then annihilated the Duke of Melcat and all his followers for heresy with a potent act of magic, making evidence of his godhood plain for all to see. Razmir's faith and earthly dominion spread quickly through the River Kingdoms after this, though his reign has been plagued by fools who continue the heresies of Duke Melcat.

Animated creatures were rare, and beyond the wind through the boughs, little moved. Then Shumunue came to establish the Court of Transcendence. In her grotto, she taught the flowers and leaves to mimic praying mantises, bees, and moths. Then came herds of wooden deer, cranes, bats, and more, all delicately carved and polished.

Long ago, she was the premier spirit worshipped in the region of Sarkoris known as the Stonewilds, and the druids of the Circle of Hierophants (or their distant predecessors) erected stone menhirs as monuments depicting the Stag Mother and her fellow spirit guides guiding and protecting the people of the region. When the Worldwound opened and demons poured forth, the Stag Mother gathered many Sarkorians to safety in her demesne, a region of the Stonewilds known as the Forest of Stones. Between the Stag Mother's godly power and the might of the lesser spirit guides that gathered under her banner, the Forest of Stones may have stood as a bastion of nature capable of withstanding even the unprecedented demonic incursion, but sadly a group of druids in the region lost faith in their long-time protectors. When the horrific perversions of druidic faith known as the Stonewild Sect transformed themselves into undead, their twisted power spread through the bonds some shared with the spirit guides, killing many of the weaker guides instantly and transforming others into dark mockeries of their former selves. In despair, the Stag Mother retreated far from the front lines of the battle, sheltering a precious few. While her worship has once again begun to spread beyond her forest home, the Stag Mother's trust of her human worshippers has been deeply undermined, and she demands that the spirit guides who live within her dominion do not form bonds with mortals or accept new god callers without her express permission.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> She Who Listens</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Druids, motherhood, sacred nature</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Act as a responsible steward of your environment, provide shelter and succor for women and children in need</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Harm a pregnant mother or innocent child, including animals</p>"

From Torag, they take the strength to be honorable and forthright and keep their word. And they look to Cayden Cailean not just for the strength to truly enjoy themselves when not working, but also to aid the oppressed. Recently, a small but growing number of followers, especially near Mzali, have been including Tlehar, too, as they seek the mental fortitude to give their best even as they hope each day will be better than the last. You'll find that these laborers won't cheat at honorable contests, swindle you, intentionally make anything subpar, or be mean or standoffish when drunk. Their religious observances tend to be frequent and regular but not at all fussy or lengthy. Ceremonies always seem to include food, drink, and games afterwards-or perhaps as part of the observances themselves.

One can't know how to cook for oneself until they know how to create a fire. Tolte Coatl encourages patience with learning and acquiring new skills.

He counts crafters among his most ardent followers, be they workers of metal, stone, or cloth. Not to be outshone, soldiers and mercenaries often pray to Torag in his aspect as protector, praying that no harm will come to them or their companions as they take the fight to those who wish harm upon what they defend.

Eventually, whether intentionally or otherwise, the people of Mzali forgot their sun gods. The sun gods watched as the people of Mzali forgot prayers and songs to their former gods.

While the sun gods appreciate this renewed faith, they did not forget Sarenrae's kindness. When asked about their disappearance, the sun gods merely state they were biding their time alongside a friend. This friendship led to the worship of the three sun gods alongside Sarenrae as a greater sun pantheon. The collective sun gods teach that kindness and second chances are pivotal values. They also note that sometimes a person needs to change into someone new before they are truly themselves and instruct that helping others with these changes is akin to helping bring new life into the world. The four gods know that there might be other forgotten gods and peoples out there that just need some kindness to make it through their period of turmoil, so they ask their worshippers to help these forgotten in whatever way they can.

Yelayne had the Wind carry her all over the world, teaching the art of weaving to any who would work at it and learning how to make the most fantastical clothes. When she tired of that, she had the Wind carry her to Heaven, where she wove starlight into constellations, sunshine into rainbows, and moonbeams into enchantments.
