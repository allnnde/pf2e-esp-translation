      "description": "<p>No one knows where and when Aakriti came into existence. Some divine scholars surmise they've always been a part of the primordial soup of creation. The most popular theory, as reflected in various religious iconography, is that Aakriti is the pupae of a primordial deity that took damage in their chrysalis state and became unable to molt into their final form.</p>\n<p>Known as Aakriti the Evershifting, this ooze deity represents the ever-evolving nature of creation and life as well the potential of the unknown. New life crawls forth from their primordial depths in an explosion of the bizarre and colorful, adjusting in their own individual ways to the challenges of existence. As each life moves through the various cycles of growth over time, they must be flexible and adapt to the changes, especially at its crux—the state of transition. Sometimes a new step involves a frightening destruction of identity, but it should be embraced instead of feared, as the primordial nothingness holds the potential for new creations beyond the wildest imaginings of one's current self. Those who stay rigid in their beliefs or refuse to change will become trapped in the shells of their old selves and crush themselves in their struggle to avoid growth. Aakriti also has no love for those who entrap creatures into a form unwillingly and will sometimes intercede against them.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> The Evershifting</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Discovery, life, ooze, potential</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Create without reservation, help others unlock their true potential, observe the mysteries of life</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> Fail to study a new creature if safely able, force a creature to live in the wrong body, reject creatures or information due to bigoted or rigid beliefs</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> molting cicada</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> insect</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> all</p>"

She used her magic to move Golarion's moon in the way of the incoming meteor, absorbing most of the destructive blast. Her body fell from the sky and plunged into the planet's core.

Known as He Who Walks in Blood, he slumbers in the blood of heretics and worshippers alike. Sleeping in an immense cleft carved into the base of the Boneyard's spire, a realm known as the Blood Vale. He keeps no formal relationships with any other deities. Even his sister, Grandmother Spider, who repeatedly attempts to coax Achaekek to rebel against the gods and abandon his duties, barely warrants acknowledgment from the mantis god.

Instead of wanting to create, his child, named Dahak, sought only to destroy.

Such a war would sweep across Golarion like a massive wildfire. Until that time, Apsu entreats mortal artists and leaders to make the world the best place it can possibly be.

She so impressed the god Aroden that, after her untimely death, he elevated her to be his herald, the Red Crusader, and she continued to fight for humanity. Yet in 3823 ar, the Knights of Ozem fatefully chose to bind her to their will as they rallied against the Whispering Tyrant. Despite her heroism in leading the charge, the Whispering Tyrant prevailed, and he took particular delight in capturing, humiliating, torturing, and finally killing her. Although the Knights of Ozem recovered her body, they—and Aroden—failed her again when the necromancer Geb had her body stolen and then reanimated against her will, turning her into a lich. In thrall to Geb for over a thousand years, she ruled his nation, all the while suffering torments that changed her profoundly. She endured all of them.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, Arazni decided to risk allying with mortals once again and, with their help, succeeded in tricking the Whispering Tyrant into destroying the magic that bound her to lichdom and to Geb.

Arazni dismissed most of her true believers as sycophants, but for those trapped by unwilling bonds and other believers beyond Geb's borders, Arazni was a paragon of resilience and determination that reflected their own fierce struggles.

While the goddess was happy to take both as lovers, the jealous brothers soon went to war with each other for her affections.

The other ocean gods attempted to intervene to disastrous effect, with many losing their lives and immortality in the ensuing battles. As the war spilled across borders and waves, other gods of sea and storm abandoned their traditional demesnes to help shield mortals from the effects of the brothers' wrath. They created bays and seas, coordinating with gods of earth and stone to form peninsulas and islands, anything that the immortal powers could arrange to curtail the brother's influence and stay the fallout of their wrath. A few gods and immortal beings of the great waters fled Golarion altogether, seeking worlds and dominions that were not active battlegrounds for potent and violent immortal forces.

Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets. His message was far from clear, however, consisting of garbled and coded texts in an untidy medley of Osirian mysticism, Pharasmin rites, and Varisian occult lore. Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR. The Esoteric Order's meticulous research has produced occult secrets and mystical rites known nowhere else on Golarion and hints at further secret lore for the enlightened.

The members of the Rivethun, which include non-dwarves, seek to make contact with various spirits. These range from the souls of the dead and undead to elementals and fey, and to other spirits that exist beyond the typical classifications.

The empyreal lord Rowdrosh is to animals what Bergelmir is to people—a guide and caretaker who binds members of a community together with common goals and feelings of kinship. It was Rowdrosh who convinced the first animals to join in groups bound not just by survival, but by companionship. Rowdrosh lived among the packs and herds, eventually settling among a herd of sheep and partially adopting their form. He was the first to domesticate an animal, and with patience and his blessing, countless people have followed in his footsteps since, taming dogs, oxen, sheep, mammoths, and far wilder creatures throughout the ages. Rowdrosh teaches people to watch over those in their charge—whether a literal herd or members of a following—and to treat animals with the kindness, care, and patience they would afford their own kin.

This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke Alseta the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as Tanagaar the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to Alseta for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From Korada, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all.

In appearance, he is said to be a congeries of iridescent spheres-brilliant, foaming bubbles that constantly expand and collapse in upon themselves. He has other manifestations, however, including the Lurker on the Threshold, a mass of black tentacles that endlessly writhe, reach, and grow, and a mysterious humanoid figure hidden behind a shimmering veil.</p>\n<p>Yog-Sothoth embodies all of space and time; he exists in all places and in all moments simultaneously. Paradoxically, however, he is unable to manifest in the mortal universe unless summoned, a magical act that almost always results in untold destruction. He is known as the Key and the Gate, and magicians and cults research him in an effort to master time and space. Fortunately, his worship is not widespread, but some of those who have delved deep into his secrets describe him as an ambivalent figure, rather than a malevolent one, who guards cosmic secrets and makes them accessible to those who dare to ask for them. Yog-Sothoth reveals the true nature of the universe, but this is a thing that once seen cannot be unseen, and wise mortals turn aside from Yog-Sothoth's offer of cosmic knowledge in favor of a more mundane existence.</p>\n<p><strong>Title</strong> Lurker at the Threshold</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> Gates, space, time</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> Gather knowledge of gates through space and time, curse or mutate unborn children</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> None</p>\n<p><strong>Religious Symbol</strong> black spiral</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Animal</strong> none</p>\n<p><strong>Sacred Colors</strong> none</p>"

Those who rail against their final judgment act out a final spiritual tragedy, the denial of the impartial force who might be their final defense against Zyphus's clutches.

As devotees of the god of death and tragedy, they see death not as a natural end of life but as the punishment for daring to enjoy life at all. Many of these spiteful worshippers came to the faith as the result of an unfortunate tragedy capitalized upon (and often engineered by) other priests of Zyphus.
