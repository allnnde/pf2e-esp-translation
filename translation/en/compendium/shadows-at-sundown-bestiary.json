A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive}.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:5] or be destroyed.</li>\n</ul>"

As the rites to do so are lost to time, very few strigoi progenitors exist today. Those who do trace their lives back well over ten thousand years ago to Thassilon, Azlant, or similar ancient empires. A strigoi progenitor may appear to possess the vitality of the living, yet closer inspection reveals sharp fangs, the faintest smell of decay, and the strange and unsettling shifting of their shadow. In life, this example strigoi progenitor was a powerful oracle and advisor in Runelord Sorshen's nation of Eurythnia.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The oldest of all vampires are the strigoi. They predate ancient nosferatus and view moroi as infantile children, yet their own origins are so far lost to the ravages of time that few today have heard of them and fewer still know their true nature. Many of the oldest tales about vampires trace back to the strigoi, and nearly every other vampire carries traits that ultimately have their roots in these powerful, ancient creatures.</p>\n<p>Strigoi, in their true form, are bodiless creatures native to the Shadow Plane that are incapable of interacting with the physical world, existing only as pure forces of malevolence. When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement-that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul-may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited.</p>\n<p>Some myths point to Urgathoa as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of Zura. Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body. Thus did the first of their kind invade the world of the living, and thus did the first vampires walk the night.</p>",

You can also leave out this step, removing the need for a Crafting check, with the same result (if you're summoning a good extraplanar creature you trust, for example). The creature can also attack or leave if you use any hostile action against it or if the warding diagram breaks.

Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions Duration]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive}.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water.

When this malevolence is invited into a physical body by method of ancient rituals, though, a strigoi becomes much more dangerous. This requirement-that a living creature perform a rite of their own free will to draw the strigoi into their soul-may well be the source of a moroi's compulsion not to enter a home without first being invited.</p>\n<p>Some myths point to Urgathoa as the source of the ritual that allowed spellcasters to become strigoi, while others suggest the method was spread by the cult of Zura. Whatever the source, this long-lost ritual was no gateway to power, but instead a trap that allowed the strigoi to inhabit the shadows and souls of once-living hosts. In so doing, they found a way to exist in the world of flesh and blood. The presence of a strigoi within the shadow of a living host causes sickness and swift death, after which the strigoi bonds with the host's soul and becomes one with the body.

          "description": "<p>All strigoi possess the following weaknesses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> Strigoi are uncomfortable near mirrors or sources of bright light. Only a strigoi's shadow reflects in a mirror, and this often compels them to cover or destroy mirrors in their presence rather than risk their true nature being displayed. A strigoi can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or source of bright light. To brandish a mirror or light source, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the strigoi involuntarily comes within 10 feet of a brandished mirror or light source, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the brandished object until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a strigoi can attempt a @Check[will|dc:25] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/gmr 1d6 #Overcome Revulsions Duration]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success). A strigoi can move normally around mirrors or bright light sources that are not brandished, although doing so causes them discomfort that can be noticed with a successful Perception check to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.1xRFPTFtWtGJ9ELw]{Sense Motive}.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> When exposed to direct sunlight, a strigoi immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious} and falls to the ground. It appears to be dead: it doesn't breathe, its body temperature matches its surroundings, and it doesn't react to pain or other stimuli. A successful @Check[perception|against:reflex] check against the strigoi's Reflex DC is enough to note one anomaly: the shadow cast by its \"dead\" body shifts and moves slightly, its edges twisting and active. Spells like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv]{Detect Alignment}, senses like lifesense, and the \"corpse\" taking damage from vitality energy still function normally, and could reveal the truth without needing a successful Perception check. Viewing the \"corpse\" in a mirror's reflection can also reveal the truth, for only the body's shadow reflects. While in sunlight and unconscious, the strigoi loses its resistance to physical damage. If the strigoi takes enough damage that it would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, its body quickly decomposes, and the strigoi is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Water Revulsion</strong> A strigoi cannot cross a significant source of running water (such as a creek, river, or waves on a seashore). A strigoi capable of flight can cross running water provided it approaches no closer than 10 feet to the liquid's surface. If forced into running water against its will, the strigoi becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2} and gains the fleeing condition as long as it remains in the water. At the end of any turn in which the strigoi remains in running water, it must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:5] or be destroyed.</li>\n</ul>"
