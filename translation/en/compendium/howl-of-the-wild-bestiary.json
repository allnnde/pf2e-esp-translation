Though it shares this trait with the docile unicorn, that's where their similarities end. Almirajes are vicious creatures, known to slaughter much larger cattle and, in times of desperation, people. Its stare is said to send even the bravest warrior running for their life.</p>\n<p>Unlike common hares, almirajes are solitary and intensely territorial. They're adaptable ambush hunters with the stamina and speed to chase down any prey. They attack with their jaws and claws but are primarily known for trying to gut their prey with a vicious stab from their horn. Many scholars believe that the terrifying magical aura the creatures exude originates from their horns. This line of thinking has led to an increase in almiraj attacks as local citizens try to capture the creature alive and remove the horn, hoping this will turn it into a more docile hare. These hopes have not proven fruitful, as an almiraj is just as aggressive, if not more so, after their horn has been removed.</p>\n<p>Adventurers often think themselves lucky if they manage to avoid the terrifying horn of this ferocious predator, but it's a much better alternative than being caught in its jaws. Almirajes have a nasty habit of grabbing their prey and vigorously shaking them until they go limp. If this fails, they'll drag their prey underground until they suffocate deep in the earth. Few have ever escaped the burrow of an almiraj.</p>",

Depending on the precise diet of the apothecary bees, they can produce a wide variety of potions, storing any excess in the waxy cells lining their nest. Apothecary bee workers are about a foot long, with yellow and black stripes. While carrying a potion, the bee's abdomen visibly swells and often changes color to match the potion within.</p>\n<p>The value of the apothecary bees' potions has led to numerous attempts at domestication, a dangerous, expensive dream with both high risks and high rewards. Once a magical garden has been established, apothecary beehives tend to become self-sustaining. Beekeepers can potentially guide their cultivation, but they're no longer necessary for the hive's survival. Some ancient, long-abandoned gardens still grow along the Sphinx River in Osirion, where many apothecary bees prowl for flowers that meet their standards. Upon their most recent dig to the surface, surki communities quickly began the process of \"trading\" with the bees, establishing habitats and using their natural magic sense to better tend the massive fields a large hive needs. Miflits, on the other hand, often end up absorbed into the bees' social structure.</p>\n<p>The potions a hive produces vary from season to season, depending on what flowers are available. Beekeepers have made strides in creating gardens that yield specific potions and have even developed harvesting techniques that increase potion effectiveness. These techniques are valuable, closely guarded secrets, but even defective potions with cursed results have found use among the followers of Calistria and Norgorber.</p>",

Thanks to these materials, most barded manticores are able to fend off just about any being attempting to encroach upon their territories, especially fiends and other creatures with weaknesses to specific metals. Barded manticores sift through metals obtained from their victims, whether that be local villagers coerced into giving them tribute or unlucky travelers, and seek the rarest, most valuable types to make part of their next meals.</p>\n<p>This also includes armor and weapons inscribed with runes that grant a barded manticore the ability to cast spells, though these spells vary depending on the region the beast inhabits and what type of runes they consume.

Although generally effective as a warning to nearby predators, these sharp cries also serve as a lure for reckless alchemists eager to study the creature's potent enzymes.</p>\n<p>Flynketts' name, most theorize, is a corruption of \"flinging kettle\" or \"flying kettle.\" They can't truly fly, instead using their skin flaps to glide in a manner similar to flying squirrels. However, the primary use of their skin flaps isn't for movement, but digestion. When it rains, flynketts roll up their loose skin, creating a crude sort of kettle in which to catch precipitation. The remarkable creatures' acid combines with the falling water to break down wood, soil, or even rocks into a nutritional stew. Therefore, the flynkett can flourish when introduced to any environment with frequent rain, something solid to stand on, and a lack of natural predators.</p>\n<p>Although their acid can be harvested without harming a flynkett, the creatures rarely cooperate. If disturbed, particularly in the middle of feeding, they release clouds of acidic steam. They're also capable of spitting the fluid with deadly accuracy. Thankfully for those who run afoul of them, flynketts have no use for corpses and will generally break off pursuit when the interloper leaves their territory.</p>\n<p>Several organizations and individual scholars have desperately sought to domesticate flynketts for use in alchemical production. To date, none of these efforts have been successful, though several abandoned labs still contain aggressive packs of flynketts who protect their new territory with ferocious tenacity.</p>",

One can often spot their burrowing by following the upended ground they leave behind, which can span for hundreds of feet. Their signature physiological feature is a shiny, gem-like cranium that's thick enough to endure repeated hits and emits a flash of colorful light with each impact.</p>\n<p>Agrarian gnome communities have a close relationship with hardhead moles. Gnome children especially hold a great fondness for the creatures, and indeed, gave them their name. When they wander into the fields to play with these molesâ€”typically by hitting them with small sticks, mallets, or any semi-blunt objectâ€”the moles are more than happy to oblige, darting from burrow to burrow with every sparkling blow in friendly games of hide-and-seek or tag.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most famous hardhead mole is the gnome goddess Nivi Rhombodazzle's planar servitor Rummbrrlar, a hardhead mole imbued by Nivi with the powers of an earth elemental. Long ago, the mighty mole was slain while rescuing children from a Nivian orphanage. As a reward for his selfless actions, Rummbrrlar was transformed into a planar servitor with diamond skin and the ability to grow as large as a mighty dragon. When communities shared by gnomes and hardhead moles are threatened, Rummbrrlar often appears to whisk bystanders to safety in the face of natural hazards or stand guard against monstrous threats. For this reason, hardhead moles are seen as a good omen and a symbol of protection in gnome communities.</p>\n<p>The average hardhead mole grows up to about 3 feet in length, but some become shorter as they age, their hard skulls flattening slightly after years of entertaining young gnomes. As they play, their heads (and the flashes of light they emit) darken in color, spanning shades of pink, red, crimson, and mauve; at seeing these darker hues, gnomes often give the moles some time to recover, as this indicates that a mole's cranium isn't getting enough blood flow. Though mischievous, hardhead moles are otherwise docile and friendly creatures. If placed in a fight-or-flight situation, they escape by creating deep networks of tunnels, which can span up to hundreds of feet in any direction.</p>",

It typically approaches prey from below, then pounces in a flurry of teeth and talons, trying to crush the target's windpipe with its powerful jaws. This ambush strategy is further aided by its dappled gray fur, camouflaging it against the rocky terrain of its native habitat. Today, holdfasts have spread far, often because of orc holds adopting them as hunting companions. This has led to tension with other peoples, who often find holdfasts too difficult to work with and consider them an invasive speciesâ€”even gnomes and druids who can speak with holdfasts find them distractable and murderously energetic.</p>\n<p>Although holdfasts watch over their litters very carefully, adults avoid each other outside of their short mating season. Despite this antipathy for others of their kind, holdfasts often trail other species of predators, acting as opportunistic scavengers. This typically ends with the holdfast bullying the other creature and stealing the greater share of any kill, but it can develop into a mutualistic arrangement. Many holdfasts have been observed hunting alongside eagles and other birds of prey, driving underground creatures to the surface for the birds to pick off.</p>\n<p>Holdfasts are difficult to contain, sliding through tiny openings and digging under fences, meaning proper enclosures must be made of stone or metal on all sides. Some orc communities instead lay out humane traps when their hunting parties are needed, using favorite treats as bait. In the orc-run nation of Belkzen, overlord Ardax the White-Hair's chief animal handler claims to have a unique and confidential training process that curbs the holdfasts' impulse to escape, but other handlers have yet to uncover or replicate it. In the Gravelands, the major orc communities face the unwelcome intrusion of undead headed by the Whispering Tyrant. While they maintain the original bond with holdfasts as hunting partners, the goal has changed from providing subsistence to eradicating undead.</p>",

Even if they can dodge it, they still might not be safe, for once the wheel stops, it unfurls into a hooplamander. Though whispered of in the remote expanses of Arcadia and feared along the grassy plains of the Mwangi Expanse, many in urban areas believe the seemingly ridiculous hooplamanders to be nothing more than tall tales. As the flattened remains of many caravans can attest, however, these apex predators are very real.</p>\n<p>Hooplamanders resemble large salamanders. They're born with retractable rear legs and an incredibly strong, flexible spine. Their sharp foreclaws feature sharp hooks that can rend flesh or stabilize it when it enters its wheel-shaped form. As they develop, hooplamanders learn how to leap and roll, hooking their tails beneath their mouths and stabilizing them with their foreclaws to form a crude wheel that they use their tail muscles to propel forward. Their backs are ridged with a tread-like pattern that gives significant traction and maneuvering power. Hooplamanders are particularly deadly when they use their hooked claws to inflict bleeding wounds before entering their \"wheels up\" form to dash around the battlefield, trampling foes and waiting for their prey to bleed out.</p>\n<p>Hooplamanders can be found wherever the ground is flat and open. Their coloring matches where they hunt, with those in grassy plains sporting brown-green skin and those in snowy regions bearing a white hide. Some naturalists believe the creatures started out as salamanders that hatched within the acidic trail of the fabled ouroboros. Others believe that nature, in its infinite variety, doesn't need magic to create such creaturesâ€”only an environment flat enough to reward their cunning adaptation.</p>",

The fights between plated pythons over territory are vicious and tend to leave long-lasting effects on the landscape. They defend their territory aggressively against other creatures they see as a threat, including people and large animals. Their habitats can be identified by the stone tunnels left behind by their burrowing, and wary travelers use these as a sign to change course.

The creature hunts by hovering just above the forest canopy, using eye-like clusters on the ends of its tentacles as a kind of inverted periscope.

The metallic scales that cover their bodies attract and absorb nearby lightning strikes, suffusing the creatures with a halo of blue or white light. Because storm snakes are most often sighted in solitude and disappear without a trace as soon as a storm recedes, a lot of folklore across Golarion considers them to be the emissaries of storm deities and harbingers of disaster.</p>\n<p>Before live clutches of storm snake young were first discovered, it was hypothesized that the creatures were made of mist and vapor; many assumed them to be illusory shapes within the clouds themselves or fleeting dragon sightings. New zoological research has found, however, that storm snakes are actually a distant cousin of dragons. Raised on mountaintops in small broods, storm snakes have underdeveloped limbs and lack any form of wing. Instead, they expand and contract their metallic scales to capture the static electricity in wind currents, which keeps them aloft during high winds and storms.</p>\n<p>Research has also shed light on the diet of these naturally shy creatures. Rather than consuming electricity, as many who'd observed them in storms believed, storm snakes are herbivorous, enjoying most varieties of grasses, plants, or tree leaves. This diet, considered alongside their flight patterns during thunderstorms, has been theorized to be a form of symbiosis; after all, any lightning strikes absorbed by a storm snake during a storm can't damage the plant growth below. Additionally, safely discharged electricity from a storm snake has been observed to stimulate growth in a wide variety of flora, all while having no adverse affects on the plants' palatability or nutritional benefits. Many farmers have tried in vain to capture, tame, or otherwise attract storm snakes to their fields to invigorate their crops during tough times, though few have succeeded.</p>",

The creatures burrow underground, forming cave systems tall enough for giants in astonishingly little time. Once the caves are excavated, the squirrels turn their attention toward the largest quantities of gems or metals they can findâ€”including those in the ground floors and vaults of nearby buildings. Nothing is off-limits, and no effort is too large when these squirrels go gem hunting.</p>\n<p>Cave squirrels' desire for these precious stones and ores arises not from greed, but rather productivity. After returning to the cave system, cheek pouches full of treasure, the males deposit the stolen goods before the females, who lick and spit on the piles of gems and metals to form them into structural pillars. Given the cave squirrels' tireless work habits, these pillars can solidify in a matter of hours, easily displacing existing stone and soil. Many an Opparan groundskeeper has stepped outside after a lovely teatime to find months of work undone in a scene of utter, glittering chaos. Architects throughout history have attempted to recreate or imitate these gleaming pillars; however, they rarely succeeded, for they often lacked a certain unpredictable pragmatism the cave squirrels seem to effortlessly achieve.</p>\n<p>When threatened, cave squirrels will let out a high-pitched scream to warn their colony.

A family of vibrant pups will abandon their dens and set out on harsh multiday journeys in search of land that can sustain the queen long enough to have another litter of pups.

The vocal mimicry of these birds did indeed allow them to harmonize with their bonded spellcaster; however, initial progress was slow, and the impatient students chose to hastily elevate the birds' abilities before their thesis deadline using experimental magic. Unfortunately, the specimens' newfound vocal mimicry was so supreme that they could mimic spell incantations as easily as any other sound they heard. The virtuosic lyrebirds soon vaporized, teleported out of, or befuddled their keepers into opening their cages, escaping into the wild and flourishing.</p>\n<p>Virtuosic lyrebirds use their spellcasting abilities mostly to play pranks and alleviate boredom.
