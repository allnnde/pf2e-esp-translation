The Bronze Lady might have her largest following in this metropolis. But the city's boomtown atmosphere means that security is a concern even on holy ground. Citizens and visitors to Alkenstar know about its wind-up sentries or quickly learn about them. The High Clockmother, head priestess of Brigh's holy place, keeps divine wardens in the goddess's image visible in the sanctuary and on the grounds. These automatons are as much a warning to would-be thieves or troublemakers as they are an inspiration to Brigh's worshippers. The mixing of divine and arcane in these constructs is intended to show off innovation and evoke Brigh's power over earth, fire, metal, and smoke.</p>\n<p>While divine wardens of Brigh can take any form, most are clockworks crafted in the goddess's image.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Created through complex rituals performed by a faith's adherents, divine wardens have been imbued with a fraction of the power that courses through a champion or cleric of a particular deity. This divine spark allows the divine warden to serve as the protector for a temple, shrine, or other holy site. Such guardians aren't intrinsically bound to a fixed location, but they rarely leave the temple or site over which they watch.</p>\n<p>Most divine wardens have been crafted from clay, stone, wood, or similar materials and typically have features that resemble a deity or a deity's herald. Divine wardens often have other abilities typically exhibited by constructs, such as armor plating, the ability to disguise themselves as statues, or other similar benefits.</p>\n<p>The faithful worshippers who craft divine wardens typically animate the constructs using a special ritual in which the followers beseech their deity to empower the guardian. The divine mandate that imbues a divine warden with power also allows the sentinel to recognize enemies of its deity and prevents the construct from attacking other members of the faith, unless these patrons choose to attack it first.</p>\n<p>In rare cases or particularly dire times, a deity might create a divine warden by directly animating an existing statue or idol to aid faithful followers. These divine guardians are most likely to be found outside of their original locations, assisting displaced congregations or pursuing those who might harm the faithful.</p>",

Medusas are shrewd and manipulative adversaries who collect and covet secrets, and who use threats and guile to exploit the fears of weaker creatures. A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves' guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek-for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa's gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster's life.</p>",

They know the pen is mightier than the sword, but the hammer is mightiest of all, and they use it mercilessly to SMASH! through their foes.</p>\n<p>Though many wordsmiths are dwarves, they come from all kinds of backgrounds, each bringing their own unique sounds and noises from their culture. Tengu wordsmiths particularly favor onomatopoeias similar to bird calls like caw for crows or okalee for red-winged blackbirds. Meanwhile, leshy wordsmiths favor sounds inaudible to most non-plant creatures, such as the tr-tr-tr that reflects the sound of a plant growing.</p>",
