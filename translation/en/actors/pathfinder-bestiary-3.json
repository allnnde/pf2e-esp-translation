As abandoned zealots move, they spit and shriek a hateful cacophony of bitter lamentations and anguished weeping.</p>\n<p>Abandoned zealots are most commonly associated with the church of Razmir, which upholds a mortal wizard as a god-a truth unknown to most worshippers. However, abandoned zealots might arise from a true religion if they've been misled about that faith's true tenets or aims. This situation could easily result from the cruel schemes and predations of sinister beings, such as shrine skelms and the blasphemous devils known as deimaviggas.</p>",

A woman dressed in white fox furs greeted him, fed him, and tended to his frostbite. In time, they married and had 10 children, five of whom bore the legs and tails of foxes. These children stayed with their mother, while the other five-born with the legs and tails of wolves-traveled with their father back to the human lands and became the first adlets.</p>\n<p>Adlets aren't inherently evil, but their culture is warlike, xenophobic, and noticeably lacking in humility. They see themselves as the natural rulers of the arctic wastes and view everyone else as squatters at best and invaders at worst. A typical adlet is stronger and faster than any mundane human, with the ability to walk naked in a blizzard and call up ice-cold mists.

It moves in a manner similar to that of the more common sidewinder snake, throwing its body forward in a loop and anchoring itself by keeping one head or the other on the ground at all times.</p>\n<p>Amphisbaenas' typical prey includes rabbits, foxes, various birds, small deer, and even humanoids if presented the opportunity. Fiercely territorial by nature, they attack just about anything that gets near their lairs, regardless of the intruder's size. Many a child has been warned about going too far into the woods alone, lest they wander too close to an amphisbaena den and become the creature's next meal.</p>\n<p>The venom of an amphisbaena is incredibly potent, able to take down a stout dwarf within minutes if left untreated. However, it also has uses in a variety of healing remedies, which makes it a valuable commodity if collected. For example, a pregnant person might be advised to drink the venom in small, dilute doses to help safeguard the pregnancy. Mixing small amounts of the venom with various herbs and oil creates a poultice which dulls aches and pains. As a result, the image of an amphisbaena appears in many contexts associated with healing and alchemical subjects, such as labels for tinctures, annotations in herbalists' records, and illustrations in textbooks of medicine.</p>\n<p>The first amphisbaena is said to have formed from the blood that fell as a medusa's head was severed. This story's origin most likely stems from the fact that amphisbaenas are oddly immune to petrification, which in turn leads to them sometimes being kept as pets by a medusa. A medusa who keeps an amphisbaena as a pet might regard the viper as their most treasured companion or perhaps even as their own child. Despite these fabled supernatural origins and the occasional special treatment they receive, however, amphisbaenas are entirely mundane animals with only rudimentary intelligence and no innate magical abilities whatsoever.</p>",

Many azers take pride in their ancestral roles and in fulfilling their inherited duties, providing needed services within their communities.</p>\n<p>Long ago, traditional azer values of self-sufficiency and close community led them to build mighty fortresses across the Plane of Fire, where they isolated themselves from other planar denizens and even other azer communities. These values, sadly, also led to their downfall. Without any connections to or regular communication with other settlements, these fortresses were easily conquered by the efreet of the City of Brass, the dominant power on the Plane of Fire. Now most azer fortresses lie abandoned and ruined, with free holds so few and far between that most think them all lost.</p>\n<p>Azers born within the efreeti Dominion of Flame belong to the populations that were conquered and assimilated into the empire ages ago.

By chewing loose these patches and swallowing them, a bauble beast magically constructs the jewelry in its guts. After passing the forgery, it polishes and reshapes the item to make it more convincing. The beast then sneaks into a settlement to place the jewelry somewhere it can be found. A creature who dons this false jewelry is compelled to fetch their real valuables and deliver them to the beast, which it happily collects. Some bauble beasts simply send the confused victim on their way, but other more evil bauble beasts slay them to avoid being found out.</p>\n<p>This imitation jewelry fools laypeople, but it's infamous among merchants. Merchant training usually includes a brief course on detecting bauble beast jewelry's subtle but distinctive sweet odor.</p>\n<p>Though largely solitary, bauble beasts occasionally socialize with others who share their limited interests, primarily merchants, jewelers, earth elementals, and other bauble beasts. Xorns have a particular fondness for bauble beasts-or at least their gems. Though these aren't as nourishing as real gems, xorns find the flavor decadent and eat them as a sort of junk food.</p>",

When a bone ship forms, necromantic magic dredges great bones from the seabed and slowly bends them into place with malicious intent. Whales' ribs typically form the timbers of the hull, and their great spinal columns twist into towering masts. Muscles and tendons lash the ship together, tightening and loosening to precisely turn the ship as it sails.</p>\n<p>When a bone ship encounters another vessel or finds some other opportunity to sow death, smaller corpses strewn throughout the ship animate to form a crew and boarding party. Each crew member resembles a humanoid skeleton, but they might be made of bones from multiple creatures. For battle, the ship also creates magical cannons formed of bone that propel bone shards and debris with blasts of magic. The small black gemstones stippled across the ship's structure hold the souls of a drowned crew, for a bone ship is the cursed legacy of dead sailors.</p>\n<p>When mass death happens at sea-often from an entire ship sinking far from shore-the anguish of the dying victims can spawn a bone ship. This event might occur when a sailor makes a final plea to a dark god or when a deity takes the opportunity to bind many dead sailors' souls together as a destructive show of divine power. When not created through divine intervention, a bone ship can grow slowly and organically from one of the ships piloted by the undead sailors known as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary-2.Actor.48agy7vl9fQW1LLA]{Draugr}. As draugr ships plague the seas and sink other vessels, they can collect more souls and bones, eventually becoming bone ships. These vessels look different from many other bone ships with patchwork or asymmetrical appearances.</p>\n<p>A bone ship is almost gluttonous, possessing an unceasing appetite for death, destruction, and new souls to add to its number. These desires stem from an underlying cause, either placed within the ship by its creator or accreted from the scattered final wishes of its component dead souls. For example, a deity might send a bone ship on a special mission to carry a message or dispose of a particularly persistent adversary or annoyance. Though bone ships usually travel upon the waves, they have no need to breathe and can carry out underwater missions at the behest of their creator.</p>\n<p>Bone ships hold a legendary reputation among sailors. These undead can appear out of nowhere to wreak destruction, and if a crew's bodies are absent from a shipwreck, the calamity might be blamed on a bone ship. The sea can bring death suddenly in many ways, but eternal enslavement of the soul presents a more terrifying fate than death alone.</p>",

Properly cared for, these \"ships of the desert\" can trek for weeks between oases without trouble.</p>\n<p>Camels have three eyelids to protect them from desert sands and other blowing debris. One lid is completely clear, which allows them to see and travel during high winds. When sandstorms strike, camels completely close their nostrils to protect their lungs. Their underbellies also sport a thick, specialized skin, allowing them to lay down safely on burning hot sands.</p>\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, fatty tissue comprises a camel's humps rather than water. This stored energy allows the animals to survive long distances between feedings. These herbivores can also readily digest hardy scrub brush inedible to other species, making them one of the hardiest desert survivors. Strong as a warhorse, camels can run fast and even sprint for short periods of time when they feel threatened, though they prefer a slow, plodding pace to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>One-humped camels, also called dromedaries, are more common in the deserts of northern Garund, while the two-humped variety are native to the dry steppes of Casmaron. Both species have tall and lanky builds, standing about 6 feet at the shoulder and weighing around 2,000 pounds. They can be ornery when mishandled, and they don't hesitate to bite, kick, or even spit a noxious substance on riders who don't treat them well.</p>\n<p>In addition to transporting people and goods, camels are a key source of fiber for clothing and tents as well as milk. Their meat is highly nutritious and surprisingly tasty, but given the creatures' utility, this use is reserved for special occasions or truly dire situations.</p>",

Some take to piracy or hire themselves out as mercenaries, but their quarrelsome disposition invariably leads to them going their own way again before too long.

Capuchins largely agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training, learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats and other pests on a ship. Some spellcasters residing along tropical coastlines have taken coral capuchins as familiars, though many claim the critters as far more trouble than any benefits they provide are worth. A capuchin familiar might pilfer spellcasting components, gemstones, vials, crafting materials, and other trinkets from their master, though a clever magic user will intersperse more appealing (and less valuable) baubles to draw their familiar's attention away from actually important items.</p>\n<p>Capuchin clans live together under a single matriarch, a slightly larger female who can be identified by her unusually prismatic skin and colorful eyes.

Every crossroads guardian exists to satisfy a particular need-usually a quest that must be carried out, helpless individuals who must be saved from harm, or an object or location which must be guarded. Although they often appear at actual crossroads, a crossroads guardian can materialize anywhere there is a community, from a giant metropolis to a lizardfolk village in a remote swamp.</p>\n<p>Some crossroads guardians are martial beings-defending a mystic fountain against all intruders, for example-but most are helpers and assistants, guiding heroes through the wilderness to where they're needed. A guardian is a skilled warrior and can defend a location, but when its purpose involves a quest, or the need is so great that the guardian isn't up to the task alone, the guardian must persuade others to voluntarily accept their quest.</p>\n<p>Once a crossroads guardian has fulfilled its purpose, it either shifts to satisfy a new need or quest-often changing its alignment and abilities as well-or else slowly vanishes, returning to the raw primal magic from which it was formed.</p>",

Cunning guides often take the form of foxes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spirit guides are a distinctive form of spiritual entity with a tenuous attachment to the Material Plane. Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.</p>\n<p>Over the passing of countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original spirit guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned the worship of traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While the people of some neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, this worship was perfectly natural. The same beings who had taught their forebears lessons that allowed them to survive and thrive still walked among them.</p>\n<p>Spirit guides can form bonds with mortal partners. While many spirit guides create a permanent bond with a mortal, such as the relationship between the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the mortal spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with recurring generations of a family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service.</p>",

The few desert giants who mingle in the societies of smaller humanoids don't bother to dispute such ridiculous rumors.</p>\n<p>In fact, desert giants' strong cultural traditions play a large part in their ability to prosper in such harsh environs. Desert giant elders encourage their descendants to maintain abstemious lifestyles, particularly with regard to the consumption of food and drink. Alcohol is particularly disdained by desert giants, who view mind-altering diuretics like liquor and ale as dangerous temptations in an environment as unforgiving as the desert. Instead, most desert giants follow a simple vegetarian diet and maintain an incredible internal map of their home region's seasonal waterways and oases.</p>\n<p>Their austere habits and intolerance for foolishness have earned desert giants a reputation as being ill-humored and no-nonsense, but many of their communities boast a wide variety of humorous tales in their vast oral histories and legends. Since desert giants' journeys across the wastes can span weeks or even months at a time, an individual who can make their companions laugh with a witty joke or amusing parable remains a prized member of the community.</p>\n<p>Desert giants stand 15 feet tall, tending toward lean physiques that are ideal for traveling across vast expanses of sand for long sojourns.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Many kinds of giants lurk in the inhospitable corners of the world, making their homes in unlikely locales ranging from fetid sinkholes and ruined battlefields to mass graveyards and barren badlands.</p>",

Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out.</p>\n<p>All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals.</p>\n<p>Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or-even worse-that their forms are a curse or punishment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dragon agathions, known as draconals, number among the most powerful of their kin, and also the wisest, embodying the wisdom of the benevolent philosopher-king. With their wisdom comes an elevation above material matters, making them the most removed from the troubles and lives of mortals. Draconals serve as the guardians of powerful magic, and they dispense their wisdom in service of the greater good of Nirvana and the celestial planes.</p>\n<p>Draconals appear more draconic than humanoid. They walk on their hind legs and balance on their long, serpent like tails. Sharp claws tip their scaled humanoid hands.</p>\n<p>Similar to true dragons, a draconal's coloration signifies different breath weapons, traits, and resistances. Draconals also choose spells from one of four domains. All have the options of the air and healing domains, but their color determines the other two. Black draconals breathe and are resistant to fire, and their additional domain options are fire and luck. Red draconals have the same fire breath and resistance, but their additional domain options are protection and sun. Green and white draconals breathe and are resistant to cold, but green draconals have the options of nature and water domains while white draconals have the options of freedom and repose. Yellow draconals breathe and are resistant to acid, and their additional domain options are earth and luck.</p>",

Einherjar dedicated to different deities often wield weapons or possess varying cosmetic appearances based on their deity's preferred weapon and their place of death; however, they're universally stalwart, implacable, and efficiently deadly. Einherjar with two-handed weapons or who arise from other backgrounds often have different abilities in place of Jotun Slayer and Instant Repair.</p>",

Within their small frames, churning vitality and void energy fiercely battle for dominance, occasionally causing convulsions and babbling speech. This intense inner conflict warps an etioling's primal magic, transmogrifying it into an occult hybrid singular to these unfortunate mortics.</p>\n<p>Nearly devoid of color, etiolings have vibrant eyes and pulsing green veins. Their bodies force the corrupting void energy out through their pores, where it distills on their skin, covering them in a thin layer of ectoplasm and concentrated death. Around them, the world withers.</p>\n<p>Incapable of focusing for long, etiolings are impulsive and moody, rapidly alternating between kindness, malice, and trickery. They forget themselves, their friends, and the things they once loved.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by void energy who still cling to life, surviving as twisted amalgams of living and undead. Though they feel unnatural cravings and resemble corpses, mortics live, breathe, eat, sleep, and procreate. However, a mortic can suspend their living functions simply by holding their breath, becoming more like a true undead.</p>\n<p>Mortics are largely new to Golarion, with most created in droves when the Whispering Tyrant destroyed entire cities with his Radiant Fire, a magical explosion fueled by the collision of void and vitality energy. From among the corpses of these tragedies rose mortics, living survivors mistaken for corpses and left behind as a result. They found themselves in a twilight state-neither fully alive or undead. The necrotic pollutants of the Gravelands and the Isle of Terror continue to create mortics, seeping into neighboring lands through the air, earth, and water to infect the populace. Though most of the living in these lands fear becoming transformed, some believe becoming a mortic is their best chance of survival in the face of the encroaching hordes of the dead.</p>\n<p>A mortic's powers differ by ancestry, though they do have a few commonalities. Reading or hearing scripture induces headaches, and they experience great discomfort when treading upon sacred ground. For those who were religious in life, these new changes can be devastating.</p>",

Strength takes many forms, some evident in their power-like the feathered bear-and some unassuming.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Spirit guides are a distinctive form of spiritual entity with a tenuous attachment to the Material Plane. Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.</p>\n<p>Over the passing of countless mortal generations, new spirit guides were born, many of them possessing traits from two or more of the original spirit guides. In the ancient human nation of Sarkoris, the people abandoned the worship of traditional gods in favor of venerating the spirit guides who watched over them. While the people of some neighboring nations saw this as heresy, to the old Sarkorians, this worship was perfectly natural. The same beings who had taught their forebears lessons that allowed them to survive and thrive still walked among them.</p>\n<p>Spirit guides can form bonds with mortal partners. While many spirit guides create a permanent bond with a mortal, such as the relationship between the spirit guides of Sarkoris and the mortal spiritual leaders known as god callers, some instead form temporary bonds, either to test the prospective mortal before committing or because a permanent bond is undesirable. It's not uncommon for a single spirit guide to form bonds with recurring generations of a family or community, protecting and guiding mortals they've grown fond of or who do them a great service.</p>",

They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators.</p>\n<p>Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack.</p>\n<p>Researchers of the necromantic processes that creates risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators.</p>\n<p>Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence. In fact, some humanoid festrogs capture and starve beastkin in hopes of the creatures rising as grotesque festrog pets.</p>",

Unlike most other aberrations, flumphs' monstrous appearance belies their true nature as gentle, good-natured creatures whose self-imposed duty is to bolster the defenses of worlds across the multiverse against onslaught from the cosmic horrors of the Dark Tapestry between the stars.</p>\n<p>Flumphs are small, jellyfish-like creatures who normally float about 5 feet off the ground on a self-generated cushion of wind, directing their movements with jets of air from countless tiny pores on the surface of their bodies. With some effort, the flumph can force air through these openings in a way that roughly approximates humanoid speech, albeit in a squeaky and halting tone.</p>\n<p>Though a flumph's underside is ringed with an array of acidic spikes that they use to hunt small prey, they are nearly defenseless against most attackers and usually attempt to flee when threatened. If cornered, a flumph can emit a foul-smelling spray capable of temporarily incapacitating enemies while warning nearby allies of their presence. This olfactory defense mechanism causes flumphs to feel more kinship with terrestrial creatures than with the jellyfish to which they bear a closer physical resemblance.</p>\n<p>Flumphs hatch from pods flung into outer space from the distant flumph homeworld in a ritual known as the Seeding. Even a newly hatched flumph has an instinctive knowledge of their purpose and seeks to make a lair close to a nearby settlement, which they then adopt as their personal charge to protect. However, remaining acutely aware of both their physical limitations and the tendency of their appearance to frighten the unsuspecting, most flumphs recruit and guide from afar, revealing their true nature only to their most trusted allies.</p>\n<p>In addition to their missions, flumphs endeavor to lead upstanding lives on a daily basis. They notably draw guidance from their dreams through exhaustive interpretations and carefully maintained dream journals. Life lessons, areas in which they can improve their behavior, and portents of alien danger all come to flumphs in dreams-or at least, that's what they believe. Despite placing so much importance on dreams flumphs have never set out to prove their dreams are authentic messages.</p>",

The story of their creation is lost to antiquity, though their propensity for attacking sea devils and alghollthus suggests they might have been engineered by some enemy of these creatures. Modern galvos aren't choosy about their prey, and because they can operate as well on land as they do in the water, they enjoy feasting on aquatic creatures and land dwellers alike.</p>\n<p>A galvo's body forms something roughly shaped like a human, but with eels continually moving throughout it and shifting the shape of its mass. The galvo can even disperse into a swarm of eels, though it usually does so only to travel through narrow spaces or otherwise accomplish things it's incapable of in its normal form.</p>\n<p>These component eels share some element of a collective consciousness, giving the galvo more intelligence than a typical animal. Individual galvos generally don't have any need for or interest in socializing, though they sometimes gather to collaborate while hunting.</p>\n<p>Electricity arcs throughout a galvo, and the more the eels that make it up move about, the larger and more impressive the electric display. This electricity creates a damaging field around the galvo that causes small fish and other sea life to drop dead. Many galvos contentedly snack on these prey. Even beyond the harmful field, underwater creatures feel a faint unease from galvos, and might notice how ferrous trinkets and sediment slowly drift toward them.</p>\n<p>A galvo attack could come from a lone creature or a small group. In addition to dangers of the electricity field generated by galvos' eels, galvos might attack by biting with their eels' maws or even firing off one of their eels like a dart, striking a distant target with a living, electrified projectile.</p>",

Some arise in bloodlines touched by creatures of chaos in generations previous, while others are changed by planar friction as the Maelstrom seethes upon the shores of creation, but all share the essence of anarchy in their blood and bone.</p>\n<p>As children of chaos, ganzis vary wildly in appearance; protean-kin remain the most common, with patches of scales and feathers and mischievous slithering tails. Others might have stranger features, such as horns, glowing orange eyes, or limbs flickering with harmless auras of entropic energy. Ganzis might be dramatically shorter, taller, thinner, or stouter than is typical for their ancestry, and it's not uncommon for them to be mistaken for more common planar scions.</p>\n<p>Independent-minded to a fault, often creative and capricious, ganzis prefer professions that allow them to serve as their own masters. If such a profession gives a ganzi opportunity to baffle or befuddle Golarion's more staid citizens, then all the better. Many ganzis develop reputations as outgoing, deviant, or thrill-seeking, and many heartily embrace these reputations and lean into them. Of all the planar scions, ganzis are among the most likely to take up life as wanderers.</p>\n<p>Ganzis with a taste for close combat are sometimes drawn to martial arts, turning their curious forms into potent and unexpected weapons. It's common to find such ganzi in the temporary employ of others, whether out of a legitimately shared ideology or simply the need for money.

Many garudas are nomadic or migratory, yearning to travel and soar above new landscapes. While they remain detached from humanoid societies, they are impetuous and gallant, frequently serving as protectors of communities near the cliffs and peaks where they roost. Some garudas instead combine their wanderlust and goodhearted nature by serving as messengers and emissaries between remote settlements, though most who take up this work abandon it after a few years when the same terrain becomes boring. Wandering garudas are no less compassionate, and many a tale tells of a garuda who came to the aid of a lost traveler or carried an endangered soul to safety.</p>\n<p>Though they hold most living creatures in high regard, garudas loathe ophidian creatures-nagas in particular.

These traits have made them celebrated explorers whose presence is welcome in a group of travelers-so long as everyone is prepared for their nigh-endless questions.

Though most comfortable on the forest floor, a porcupine can climb trees adeptly to seek out leaves, bark, and insects for food. The giant porcupine is no less shy than its smaller kin, but these 5-foot-long specimens climb only the ancient old growth of deep forests. Both species are found only in temperate woodlands, though a giant porcupine prefers forests with less undergrowth where it can maneuver more easily. When startled or threatened, a porcupine employs multiple strategies to discourage potential predators. It emits a pungent odor that warns other creatures away, rattling its quills and chattering its teeth loudly to provide an additional auditory warning. If cornered, it raises its quills, faces away from the danger, and charges backwards at full speed, impaling any unlucky creatures is in its path.</p>\n<p>A porcupine's barbed quills-in actuality long, stiff hairs-hook into a foe's flesh. A creature can easily pull free from the porcupine should a creature come into contact with one, but the quill's barbed tips continue to dig into the victim's skin from the creature's own movements. Removing the quills is a painful process, and quills that break off under the skin can sometimes requires a healer's assistance to remove effectively. Contrary to popular belief, however, a porcupine can't shoot its quills, making it a threat only to a creature brazen or foolish enough to attack it directly.</p>\n<p>Porcupines use the same defensive tactics regardless of size, but the giant porcupine is often devastatingly effective given its sheer mass. Fortunately, these creatures tend to flee at the first opportunity to do so. The few attempts to train them as guardians have ended poorly for this reason, though some druids and other woodfolk have, on occasion, persuaded these creatures to accompany them as companions.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Giant seahorses are bear-sized, docile versions of their tiny, more common cousins. Merfolk and other underwater cultures often use them as pack animals, while some coastal cultures ride them as mounts. Earning a seahorse's trust can be rather difficult given their skittish nature, but giant seahorses can express incredible loyalty and affection once they bond with someone, even going so far as to risk their own well-beings to defend someone who has earned their trust. They don't take to combat naturally, though, and in dangerous situations, they're more likely to try and grab their rider with their strong, prehensile tails before swimming to safety, rather than staying in a fight. Like smaller seahorses, giant seahorses have bony armor plates on the outside of their bodies, covered by skin, which makes them fairly durable despite their reluctance to battle.</p>\n<p>Though not the strongest swimmers, seahorses rely primarily on natural camouflage to survive. Chromatophores in seahorses' skin allow them to camouflage themselves. This ability is fairly rudimentary, and the size of a giant seahorse makes this tactic far less effective for them than for their smaller kin. Their colors change slowly at most times, though when in a dangerous situation, the process occurs much more rapidly for the seahorse.</p>\n<p>Unlike regular seahorses, giant seahorses also rely on herd tactics for defense as well as their surprising physical strength. A herd of charging seahorses is just as terrifying and dangerous underwater as a herd of stampeding horses on land. Humanoids in underwater cultures learn at a young age to quickly get out of the way of a herd of stampeding seahorses.</p>\n<p>Baby giant seahorses are too big to easily float and lack sufficient strength to swim on their own for several weeks after birth. They instead link tails with an adult and allow themselves to be ferried around. An adult seahorse can carry upwards of 20 seahorse babies hanging from them at once, though these babies might occasionally get left behind or swept away by a strong current. Caring for these helpless, wayward children is seen as a supreme act of kindness by many merfolk, who'll let these babies wrap their tails around staves and other implements and rear them into adulthood.</p>",

Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock.</p>\n<p>Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets.</p>\n<p>While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode. While this belief isn't strictly true, vultures do have several unique adaptations to avoid common diseases that would take out predators or even other scavengers. Due to their size, giant vulture talons in particular are sometimes used to craft weapons in regions where other resources are scarce.</p>",

Instead, girtablilus exclusively revere and protect sites dedicated to deities considered lost to civilization. In this way, they act as preservers of holy practices that have otherwise been forgotten beneath the desert's shifting sands.</p>\n<p>Though girtablilus are used to explorers seeking entrance to the sites they defend, they might welcome those who earnestly wish to learn or offer reverence. A few even proudly share their beliefs with others, eager for the opportunity to preach to someone new. But girtablilus show no mercy to those who attempt to desecrate the sites and objects of their worship, or to those who would violate the tenets of their faith.</p>\n<p>Girtablilus are skilled fighters who keep trained giant scorpions as pets, and they remain unmatched when it comes to fighting in the desert. They require relatively little food or water, and they rely on their stamina to outlast their enemies. When necessary, they can stalk their quarry for days or even weeks, coordinating with their pets to drive their prey in circles. Once exhausted, few foes can stand up to a girtablilu's physical prowess-or their deadly venom.</p>",

Gurgists ceaselessly crave raw meat; consuming large quantities can slow, or even reverse, their body's putrefaction for a short time. A gurgist that refuses to consume raw meat rots to death.</p>\n<p>Unlike other mortics, gurgists are capable of sating their hunger without resorting to depravity, making them more likely to be nonevil compared to other mortics. Most gurgists hunt and raise livestock for food-including animals many consider too dangerous to tame. To battle their constant hunger, many take up a single craft, hobby, or performing art to obsess over until the drive to create overcomes the urge to consume. Many study magic or medicine, researching methods to reverse their condition or suspend their putrescence. Others cling to religion, uttering prayers despite the pain and begging the gods to cleanse them of evil.</p>\n<p>Nearly all gurgists are disgusted by their clumsy, rotting bodies. They shroud themselves in fine clothes and cover their faces with elaborate masks. Most consider their mask their true face.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Mortics are humanoids overwhelmed by void energy who still cling to life, surviving as twisted amalgams of living and undead. Though they feel unnatural cravings and resemble corpses, mortics live, breathe, eat, sleep, and procreate. However, a mortic can suspend their living functions simply by holding their breath, becoming more like a true undead.</p>\n<p>Mortics are largely new to Golarion, with most created in droves when the Whispering Tyrant destroyed entire cities with his Radiant Fire, a magical explosion fueled by the collision of void and vitality energy. From among the corpses of these tragedies rose mortics, living survivors mistaken for corpses and left behind as a result. They found themselves in a twilight state-neither fully alive or undead. The necrotic pollutants of the Gravelands and the Isle of Terror continue to create mortics, seeping into neighboring lands through the air, earth, and water to infect the populace. Though most of the living in these lands fear becoming transformed, some believe becoming a mortic is their best chance of survival in the face of the encroaching hordes of the dead.</p>\n<p>A mortic's powers differ by ancestry, though they do have a few commonalities. Reading or hearing scripture induces headaches, and they experience great discomfort when treading upon sacred ground.

They're quite intelligent and don't appreciate condescension from those who treat them as simple animals.</p>\n<p>Tiny dragons have appeared in tales told among traditional Varisian communities for centuries, but only relatively recently have they become known by the name \"house drake.\" This new name arose in the city of Korvosa, where house drakes have adapted particularly well to urban life. When students of the magic school called the Acadamae failed in their studies and allowed their imp familiars to run wild, these tiny dragons found that they were particularly well suited to combating them. Most notably, their teeth become striated with silver due to their peculiar grooming habits, allowing their bites to puncture the imps' magically resistant skin. The two species are well-matched in intellect. Though their clashes typically begin with trying to outwit one another, they often end in messy brawls across rooftops and into alleys. The residents of Korvosa appreciated both the protection and the dragons' charming appearance and demeanor. House drakes are now more common in Korvosa than anywhere else in the world.</p>\n<p>House drakes are carnivorous, eating vermin and small birds. Though they're capable of hunting for food, many of them find it a bit dull and prefer to spend their time at other pursuits. They happily accept donations of food. To truly get on a house drake's good side, though, one should offer a gift of silver. Donations to drakes have become regular practice in Korvosa, to the point where \"Paid any drakes lately?\" has become a common phrase to suggest someone is a bit gullible and soft-hearted. These donations are just that-charity. House drakes avoid taking on anything resembling a \"job,\" taking pride in their self-sufficiency and ability to choose for themselves how to spend their time.</p>",

These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength.</p>\n<p>Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away.</p>\n<p>Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest-cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant few trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat.</p>\n<p>Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.</p>",

The true cruelty of the enchantment became clear only later-the japalisura had a new face, but that face transformed into a different one every minute, each more hideous than the last.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Asuras are, above all, proof that the gods are not infallible. These fiends arose as physical manifestations of divine accidents, taking form when the gods themselves stumbled and blasphemed on a cosmic scale. As a result of their own divine genesis, an asura loves above all to undo the workings of the divine. They eagerly travel to the Material Plane, seeking out temples, congregations of faithful worshippers, and religious orders of all stripes to sow doubt and destroy what the gods seek to build.</p>",

These generally placid herbivores are shy of other creatures, preferring to live in open grasslands where their keen ears and eyes can spot danger approaching from a distance.</p>\n<p>Male kangaroos develop powerful front limbs and exhibit a dominance behavior commonly known as \"boxing.\" When two male kangaroos confront each other, they draw close; they then swat at their opponent with their front claws while also pulling their own heads back out of range. Kangaroos also occasionally rock back on their tails before delivering a blow with their heavily muscled hind legs. The claws on their back legs make these blows particularly deadly, and a kangaroo can disembowel an attacker with a single strike using this tactic.</p>\n<p>Like other marsupials, female kangaroos carry their young-called joeys-in a pouch on their bellies. They have only one such offspring at a time, although many females have several joeys in quick succession. These social animals largely gather for protection, but their social structures are similar to those found in herds of camels, horses, or pigs.</p>\n<p>Kangaroos don't make particularly good mounts, but this hasn't stopped the occasional adventurous gnome or halfling from trying. Such an attempt usually results in a seasick and dizzy rider being dumped unceremoniously from the animal's back or pouch, but some druids have found them to be loyal companions.</p>\n<p>In places where kangaroos are common, the animals are sometimes hunted for meat and can even provide a primary food supply to migratory communities due to their quick reproduction and ability to flee predators. People in other regions consider kangaroos a delicacy and often import their meat as a show of status in wealthy households.</p>\n<p>Several types of kangaroos have evolved, each living in a slightly different environment. Gray kangaroos are smaller than other varieties and dwell in open woodlands, most commonly on the southern reaches of the continent of Garund. Giant kangaroos, found primarily on the dry steppes of northern Casmaron, grow to twice the size of standard kangaroos, and the thunderous noise of their passing can be heard and felt from miles away. The kangaroo family also has several smaller relatives, including wallabies and pademelons. Some kangaroos exist in captivity in other parts of the world, but attempts to introduce them into other regions have-so far-largely failed.</p>\n<p>A large kangaroo can reach over 6 feet in height and weighs up to 200 pounds.</p>",

Water from a kappa's home lake, stream, or river fills these depressions, or head bowls, which are believed to be the source of their strength. Younger kappa are easily tricked into bowing and accidentally emptying the water out of their own head bowls. Losing this water makes the kappa lethargic. The longer a kappa's head bowl remains empty, the weaker they grow. While this issue rarely poses a serious danger for a kappa living near their home body of water, it can prove fatal to a more adventurous kappa.</p>\n<p>Kappas aren't inherently hostile and have been known to befriend lonely children and lend aid to stranded adventurers by providing directions or minor medical treatment. Still, many areas known to house kappas have signs both warning of the creatures' presence and encouraging travelers venturing over or through water to first toss in a cucumber, kappas' favorite food, in exchange for safe passage.

It was this corruption of the cycle of souls that spawned the first sahkils.</p>\n<p>Ambivalent to the prescribed order of the multiverse and spiteful of mortals, sahkils delight in spreading fear and unease to all beings, clogging up the metaphysical cycle with anxiety-ridden mortals too scared to achieve their potential. These fiends have drastically changed from their dedicated psychopomp predecessors. They are creatures of spite and torment, fear and disgust. They exploit the most common and rare fears for their own perverse satisfaction, and they want nothing more than to frighten mortals and make them question their reason for existence.</p>\n<p>Most sahkils lurk on the Ethereal Plane, but they frequently invade the Material Plane to torment mortals and spread terror. They use their innate ability to slip between the veils of the Ethereal and Material effortlessly, often stalking their targets for days or weeks before enacting their devious plots.</p>",

Although kishis can cast charm to make unwitting companions complacent, most of these sinister creatures prefer to trick their prey using guile, gifts, and their dashing good looks. These ultimate sadists derive pleasure from the thrill of the hunt as well as the delicious reward at the end.

Kishis consume every part of their victims' bodies, leaving no trace of the crime-even lapping up any spilled blood, claiming the victim's treasures as their own, and cleaning the murder scene as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Few things can bind a community together as swiftly as uncovering a kishi.

Favored by the goddess Daikitsu, kitsune seem to be almost supernaturally lucky, perpetually dodging danger by the narrowest margins.</p>\n<p>While kitsune settlements do exist, most kitsune are incredibly curious and often leave home at a young age to encounter new people and sights. Some kitsune spend years in their tailless form, living disguised among humanoids in urban or rural societies whose inhabitants have no clue of their true nature. Others go to the opposite extreme, spending most of their lives in the form of a fox, only to reveal themselves at the most opportune moment. For many kitsune, revealing their true form to someone is a sign of great trust, but it's also not uncommon for kitsune to display their dual nature openly.</p>\n<p>Kitsune's connection to the spiritual world grants them a number of magical abilities.

The form fits the terrain, with dwellings nestled into crags on a mountain or forming a windbreak on a plain.

His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born-Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times.</p>\n<p>Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds.</p>\n<p>To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year.</p>\n<p>Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches.

This unnatural process transforms the ki, and thereby the body. The lower chakras are considered \"safer\" to replace. Most Paaridars stop at the root, sacral, and navel chakras. To go farther risks losing control of one's emotions and intellect entirely, a fate Paaridus himself succumbed to.

These stories hold a grain of truth, as gracious fey do occasionally journey from the First World to aid a humble artisan on a whim, for bribes of food, or sometimes even as part of a concerted effort to spread beauty throughout the world. However, when an artisan becomes too reliant on this help, their friendly fey helper might become warped and twisted with resentment and neglect. Eventually, they could transform into a cruel prankster who delights in punishing mortals who dare task a fey with such mundane work. The millindemalion is the result of a kindly, hat-making fey undergoing such a transformation.

They're majestic, territorial, and extremely grumpy-traits that make them dangerous to unwary travelers and would-be predators alike. Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate.</p>\n<p>For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual.</p>\n<p>A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose.</p>\n<p>Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose. To an observer watching from the safe distance of a dry shore, the large branching antlers of a swimming moose can sometimes be mistaken for a tree bobbing along in the water.</p>",

Like snakes, nagaji are cold-blooded and reproduce by laying eggs; as a result, nagaji territories rarely overlap with those of mammalian humanoids, since their environmental needs diverge so widely.

But the nagaji were never mindless vassals, and the goddess gifted them with free will. Many nagaji willingly serve nagas to this day, honoring some as outright divinities. While outsiders might regard nagaji initially as brainwashed servants, nagaji dispute this claim. Of course there are evil and unfair naga overlords, but there are just as many fair and just naga rulers, and nagaji history remembers various rebellions and revolutions when a matriarch overstepped her bounds to support a new naga's claims of rulership.

To the tiny ostovites, bigger is better, and building large skeletal conveyances is the only way for them to increase their standing in life. Although they feel deeply inferior to creatures larger than themselves, this fear can be overwhelmed by the ostovites' visceral desire to harvest those creatures' bones to increase their own status. When confronted with a particularly massive skeleton, ostovites generally fight among themselves and end up splitting the haul. However, there are rare instances of the selfish creatures working together to puppeteer a much larger bone chariot.</p>\n<p>Ostovites' faint understanding of anatomy results in bone chariots that look more like a nightmarish attempt at art than any creature the bones were pulled from. Some powerful fiends and their admirers collect this strange art by bribing ostovites with skeletons or finding ways to kill ostovites without disrupting the chariot around them.</p>\n<p>Despite ostovites' origins in the Abyss, they are neither demons nor qlippoth. Without the protection of the major fiends, they find their homes in nooks and crannies along the corners of their home plane. Though they have no innate ability to cross the planar boundaries, flaws in the Abyss's fabric often lead them to worlds across the planes. Ostovites that have thus migrated are often much happier. Away from demonic abuse, they usually can be found near mortal crypts and battlefields.

Though they're prevalent as a symbol, often scrawled across the margins of alchemical tomes, few know that the beasts actually exist in the Astral Plane, where they fly through the silvery-gray void like a serpentine wheel. The ouroboros is usually depicted as a snake devouring its tail. This circular symbol is synonymous with infinity, self-sufficiency, and eternal unity.</p>\n<p>An ouroboros' form exemplifies the unfathomable concepts of forever. Its undulating body is composed of smaller serpents, who are in turn composed of ever smaller serpents, continuing indefinitely. These smaller components are recycled as the ouroboros devours its tail, existing in a perpetual, cyclical process of creation and destruction. It is a massive creature, forming a loop roughly 50 feet in diameter and weighing hundreds of tons.</p>\n<p>An ouroboros's most striking feature is its ability to almost instantly grow new flesh and heal from nearly any wound. This profound regenerative ability comes in part from an ouroboros's magical blood, which is rumored to have many miraculous properties.</p>\n<p>Through their inscrutable behavior suggests that an ouroboros is mindless, the creatures boast crude intellects and can understand speech, though they have no way to speak. They possess an instinctive, almost obsessive will to survive and defend themselves ferociously if threatened in even the slightest way. Often these perceived threats take the form of another creature simply existing within the ouroboros's line of sight, leading other Astral creatures to give these powerful beings a wide berth. The only creature an ouroboros reliably ignores is another ouroboros, but they're so incredibly rare that these meetings occur only once an age.</p>\n<p>Being entirely self-sustaining, an ouroboros rarely deigns to emerge from its consumption to engage with the Material Plane. Yet, the creature remains capable of inflicting tremendous devastation that far surpasses what it could wreak leveraging only its massive size alone. Left to its own devices, an ouroboros is likely to simply roam the Astral Plane in eon-spanning cycles, following some pattern too long and large for any mortal to even chart, much less fully comprehend. When conjured to the Material Plane, however, an ouroboros eagerly begins to initiate the cycle of renewal for which it is best known, beginning with that cycle's first step: destruction.</p>",

They assume titles that allow them maximum freedom to punish or hurt others with minimal oversight: any vindictive guard captain, tyrannical viceroy, or needlessly cruel magistrate could be or become a palace skelm. They delight in the wealth and status of their positions, garbing themselves in ornate finery that reflects their station.</p>\n<p>Palace skelms ingratiate themselves with powerful individuals and gather followers by stoking fears of losing long-held or hard-earned power-especially power gained through illicit means. They undermine their enemies by encouraging competition, jealousy, and outright paranoia by way of magic and false messages. These skelms possess an unnatural ability to twist spoken words and worm their manipulative magic into others' speech, sowing confusion and hatred that might explode into violence.</p>\n<p>A political upheaval is a palace skelm's greatest fear and opportunity alike, upsetting the balance of power he has built but providing countless new opportunities to sow hatred and evil. This conflicting goal leads palace skelms to self-sabotage and undermine their own efforts more than any other skelm.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy.</p>\n<p>An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge.</p>\n<p>Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger.</p>",

Agathions are born from the souls of mortals who attained the enlightenment they sought in life, sometimes even after death. Because they all start out as mortals who were rewarded for their determination, self-awareness, and purity of heart, agathions are more likely than other celestials to intervene in working nonviolently against the spread of evil on the material plane. Agathions have served as moderators between the chaotic azatas and lawful archons, so they know how vital communication with mortals can be to bridge differences and ensure that evil doesn't win out.</p>\n<p>All agathions possess animal-like aspects, some appear more anthropomorphic, while others spend most of their time in forms nearly indistinguishable from true animals. Still others prefer to shapeshift as they see fit, or present as humanoid when in the company of humanoid mortals.</p>\n<p>Each type of agathion serves a specific role in Nirvana. Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment. Since agathions receive their animal forms as rewards for their mortal lives, they take great insult with insinuations that they're merely magical talking beasts or-even worse-that their forms are a curse or punishment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As the most whimsical and playful of the agathions, procyals are the most likely to be encountered on the Material Plane, teaching deep philosophical lessons and delivering wisdom through pranks and impersonations. Mischievous and playful, these raccoon-headed humanoids love to socialize with mortals and learn about their societies. Unlike their mortal counterparts, Procyals' fur starts off dark russet in color, giving way to gray and white flecks on their muzzles as they grow older. Only procyal leaders boast the stark gray and black coloration of a true raccoon. Those who recognize procyals' age and wisdom treat these creatures with great respect.</p>\n<p>Whatever their natural appearance, procyals make excellent shapeshifters and can assume the form of any humanoid that they've encountered. They use this ability only for the greater good of that humanoid or their community, often appearing as someone's trusted mentor to deliver an important message in a more laid-back fashion than talking to a magical celestial raccoon. They're not above playing the occasional harmless prank on the person whose form they've assumed, especially when they can use it to teach a valuable lesson. Raccoon agathions prefer to use a blade if forced into combat, but they're prepared to use their claws and fight dirty if necessary.</p>",

Others posit they were once a cult of demon worshippers whose dark rites transformed them into their current forms. No matter their true origins, sabosans have infamous reputations among towns and cities south of Golarion's equator.

In such cases, glimpses through the underbrush are typically the best an onlooker can hope for, as sasquatches are perfectly content to live their lives in peace hidden in the deep thickets of the wild.</p>\n<p>Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are capable of moving through forests with surprising grace and efficiency. Often, their distinctively pungent odor or the discovery of a few sets of unusually oversized footprints are the only signs of their presence. These footprints have helped to engender a popular nickname, \"bigfoot,\" for these mysterious creatures.</p>\n<p>While normally nonconfrontational, a sasquatch can be driven to violence when startled or when their homeland is threatened, be it by the expansion of pioneers or the intrusion of fell supernatural influences. Usually, a sasquatch's attack lasts as long as it takes to frighten away a foe; they rarely pursue those who flee from their displays of dominance.</p>\n<p>Sasquatches speak their own language, which mixes sounds easily mistaken for ambient wildlife calls and knocking-most often by striking a solid surface (such as a tree) with a branch or a stone -allowing a whole family of sasquatches to carry on conversations without alerting nearby humanoids. Even in death they avoid leaving traces behind, for when a sasquatch dies, their kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide the grave site well to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike.</p>",

Their most distinctive apparel are their white stone masks, which shae don only when they must put on a discernible \"face\" for interacting with humanoids and similar creatures. They do so begrudgingly, as they consider themselves superior to humanoids, but donning their masks allows them to be more easily understood and thus keeps their interactions with their lessers as brief as possible.</p>\n<p>The dynamic between a shae and humanoids shifts when humanoids come to worship a shae, however. A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages. Even getting a meeting with such a self-important shae can present a challenge that requires one to deal with many layers of hangers-on who insist on vetting the newcomer before wasting the shae's precious time.</p>\n<p>According to shae lore, they've transcended the material world and now embody a cosmological equilibrium of reality and illusion. Their claims to metaphysical ascendance and knowledge of the secrets of shadows entice many mortal supplicants to join shae courts and cults. In the shae language, their name means \"unbound,\" in accordance with their belief that their ephemeral nature makes them free of the moral and social strictures that bind other sentient creatures, and they essentially make a virtue of capriciousness. Shae feel little obligation to follow through with oaths or obey laws, so sealing a compact with a mortal means little to them.</p>",

Most practitioners capable of binding a shikigami wouldn't engage in this type of disrespect, but should the kami catch wind of such practices, shikigami across the land might abandon their contracts en masse, leaving an uncomfortable vacuum with their unexpected exodus. In this way, shikigami exemplify the precarious balance between the expansion of civilization and the preservation of the natural world.</p>\n<p>Not all shikigami protect gardens, so you can substitute the shikigami's spade for any sort of mundane tool that's useful to the shikigami's task and their ward.

      "publicNotes": "<p>The unquestioned authority that a priest wields, with influence over even the most intimate details of a congregation's lives, is the ultimate prize for a shrine skelm. Most shrine skelms insinuate themselves into positions of judgment in powerful religious groups to gain that power for their own use and abuse. Shrine skelms wear the old-fashioned, traditional apparel of whatever faith they've infiltrated, brandishing religious symbols made of precious metals to better blend in and give an impression of age and power.</p>\n<p>No matter what religion they infiltrate, a shrine skelm is a master at taking established teachings out of context to justify elaborate, painful, and often humiliating punishments for his victims. He usually targets people with the audacity to question his position or teachings, but also relentlessly harasses anyone he envies.</p>\n<p>Shrine skelms are skilled listeners, especially in settings like group prayers where they can learn worshippers' fears or hopes. They exploit whatever information they learn for their own prestige and power, but they also watch for jealousy and the seeds of rage that could be nurtured to make a new skelm. They can even intercept sincere prayers and steal their effects for themselves, and they command several spells to manipulate and control their unwitting, vulnerable victims.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy.</p>\n<p>An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge.</p>\n<p>Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger.</p>",

Their duties and forms generally reflect the core values they cultivated in life that led them to their enlightenment.

At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however.</p>\n<p>Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity-hence its name-before lapping up the tasty insides.</p>\n<p>Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication.

They bully living victims as well, stoking regret and shame even from inconsequential minutiae or outright fabrications until these feelings become unbreakable ties that the skelm can leverage from beyond the grave. A soul skelm's attentions can leave a victim isolated from friends and allies, making them all the more susceptible to the skelm's manipulations.</p>\n<p>Ambitious soul skelms-often those who arise from palace skelms-search out powerful, high-strung mortals and trick them into bringing ridicule or shame on themselves. After their victim's death, the skelms gleefully remind them of their mortal failings, feeding on their despair.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rage-filled skelms are drawn to any settlement with more than a few hundred souls. Using magical disguises and leveraging societal norms to their benefit, these antlered monsters crave fearful respect and brutally punish any who dare disagree with their lofty opinions, even in the slightest degree. Although quite dangerous on their own, skelms are at their deadliest when leading an angry mob. Their cruel and exploitative nature has made their name synonymous with villainy.</p>\n<p>An existing skelm can transform any evil humanoid who's overwhelmed with rage into one of their kind. Skelms heap enraging humiliation on potential new brothers as a form of indoctrination, convincing these recruits that some other person or group is responsible for their misery. This practice ensures skelms begin their new existence with sufficient vitriol to plot their revenge.</p>\n<p>Many newly forged skelms carry on their lives in the roles they held as mortals; and in fact, these roles often shape the type of skelm they become. Skelms can arise among members of nearly any ancestry, though they're more common among cultures with deeply entrenched gender roles, unjust hierarchies, and those that don't offer healthy ways to experience and process anger.</p>",

Their hair ranges from common colors found among humans to bright reds, greens, or blues. They're the only dragons with five digits per claw, a mark of special importance.

Unlike other true dragons, imperial dragons dive deep into human affairs. Some remain secretive, posing as reclusive hermits, while others keep a high profile, openly ruling factions.

In the second cycle, each element counters another: wood counters earth, earth counters water, water counters fire, fire counters metal, and metal counters wood.</p>\n<p>Each imperial dragon represents one element and has four abilities related to the cycle.

A newly emergent people, sthenos have existed for just barely over a century. Only a few generations have passed since their genesis, and some adult sthenos remember members of the original generation. Indeed, since sthenos can live about as long as humans, a few of the original sthenos might yet live somewhere. As a people without a traditional homeland, sthenos seek to find societies that welcome them, which can be a challenging endeavor. With more than</p>\n<p>a passing resemblance to medusas, given their ophidian hair and striking features, they find most places are wary if not outright hostile to their presence.</p>\n<p>All sthenos descend from a single woman of the same name. Stheno rebelled against the poisoned gift of nightmares that the goddess Lamashtu granted her sisters, the powerful medusa matriarchs known as euryales. Stheno prayed to Shelyn, goddess of art and love, for help in overcoming her twisted birthright. Eventually, Lamashtu's power struck Stheno down, but Stheno's remaining faith and will imbued each of the hundred snakes from her hair with a mind and will of its own. Each snake grew into an individual stheno, and a new ancestry was born that day.</p>\n<p>Sthenos have been slowly spreading across the land, their numbers growing as they can have children with humans. In these families, children of all genders are born either fully human or fully stheno, seemingly at random. Sthenos with a welcoming community to call home tend toward large families with many children, perhaps from some survival instinct as early members of a new ancestry.</p>\n<p>Sthenos, unsurprisingly, have a great love for snakes, and they tend to keep other snakes as pets and companions to their hair. Stheno hair snakes are non-venomous and love to eat insects within their reach. They are semi-autonomous, though their behaviors are colored by the stheno's emotions. An angry stheno might find their snakes lashing out at the subject of their wrath, while an amorous stheno's snakes might just want to snuggle instead.</p>",

Their lurching head movements and vertical eyelids give an unnerving quality to their humanoid appearances.</p>\n<p>Strix, called itarii in their own language, live in tightly bonded roosts nestled into the cliffs and treetops of Golarion's highest elevations. Their societies mostly share a communalist, tribal structure, each led by a female leader called a rokoa. Their dwindling population, combined with the adversity they face, promotes interconnectedness and empathy, even between different tribes. By contrast, strix face an ageless conflict with the human populations that surround their home at Devil's Perch, forced to fiercely defend their ancestral territories against human incursion. As a result, strix distrust humans on sight, though these grudges typically don't extend to human offshoots, such as half-orcs and half-elves.</p>\n<p>Oral tradition tells that the strix who live among the spires of Devil's Perch, an area in the southwest region of Cheliax's Menador Mountains, were banished there by a massive storm as punishment for an ancient, forgotten transgression. Strix communities debate whether this curse still haunts their people. Those that believe so cite the endless bloody conflict between the strix tribes and the nearby humans, who regard the strix as winged devils to be purged from their territories. Due to strix's deep emotional connection to each member of their tribe, any strix life taken by human hands leads to swift retaliation, which humans use to paint strix as monsters. This cycle of retribution, along with continuous loss of strix land, has bred generations of hatred.</p>",

They deceive and mislead with their formidable magic, leaping from tree to tree while laughing, or neighing, uncontrollably. While not malicious, neither are they empathetic to the plight of their victims. They would sooner forget about those whom they have played tricks on and leave them to die than lead them back to their intended path through guilty altruism.</p>\n<p>A tikbalang's occult magic stems from the esoteric mystery of believing the lie. In the moment of crafting illusions or conjuring extradimensional spaces, the tikbalang themself believes that what they are creating is real. This makes their spells harder to resist, and this same principle also makes them very effective liars. But this readiness to believe also makes them susceptible to deceptions and illusions in turn, and they are particularly vulnerable to mind games. Lone travelers without magic of their own often learn riddles, sleight of hand, or other tricks to defend against a tikbalang's oft-deadly entertainment. Other whispers suggest wearing one's shirt inside-out to confuse the creatures, or passing by a tikbalang's forest quietly to avoid drawing their attention.</p>\n<p>Unlike most illusionists, tikbalangs can also rely on their physical prowess should the need arise. They have unusually long legs that end in cloven hooves, and they stand as tall as ogres when upright. Skilled climbers and leapers, they are also well known for being master wrestlers, where their long limbs put them at a distinct advantage over their foes. They have elongated faces that, when combined with their well-kempt hair, suggest an equine appearance-although some tikbalangs have saurian or birdlike faces instead.</p>",

A tupilaq manifests from hateful magic-a thing that can be created only by someone who believes they were grievously wronged. When a terrible, unforgivable crime is committed against someone with great skill at carving and who has knowledge of the proper ritual, the aggrieved can channel their grief and hate through whispered incantations to bring a tupilaq to life.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the same emotions used to create a tupilaq often lead to even greater tragedies. Functionally immortal but built for vengeance a tupilaq lacks the reason or discernment to do anything other than pursue the goal imbued by its creator. A wish to utterly destroy an enemy can lead a tupilaq to slaughter an entire clan or settlement, killing until it has slain everyone even remotely related to the original offender. There are many stories where a tupilaq ends up causing more tragedy for its creator than the crime that precipitated its creation. The most common tales feature the tupilaq eventually murdering its creator's spouse or family members due to a distant relationship to the original target that no one knew about.</p>\n<p>Tupilaqs' animating energies aren't tied to their original functions, and the creatures typically long outlast their creators, their victims, and often any who recall the reason for their creation. They might fall into a sort of hibernation once they've achieved immediate vengeance, but they frequently reawaken to continue their rampage against unsuspecting targets ignorant of their involvement.</p>\n<p>Spellcasters might occasionally summon these constructs. Summoned tupilaqs, hauled unceremoniously from their vengeance, become near-frenzied combatants, unleashing every offensive ability in their arsenal to break free. These reactions aren't strategic or considered, but an instinctual, almost programmed need to return to their true purpose. Conjurers should be wary about tupilaqs employing spells that might be turned against their summoners, such as a fireball spell \"accidentally\" placed such that it incinerates the spellcaster and returns these creatures from whence they came.</p>",

Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed.

These opportunistic hunters value their self-preservation, but use fast-acting nonlethal poisons to subdue their targets for safe and minimally destructive harvesting. Few umasi harbor malice toward the living, but some possess a streak of self-loathing and search for powerful magics that might break whatever curse binds them to their current state.

Many of them learn to use their tails to capably manipulate objects.</p>\n<p>Vanaras are a friendly people, but their boundless curiosity and love of pranks has a tendency to strain their relationships with other humanoids, and thus they usually make their homes far from urban areas. The majority of vanara settlements are found in southeastern Casmaron, among the lush jungles where they first originated. Devotion to monastic training and magical study has led to secondary populations forming in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray, eastern Katapesh, and northeastern Nex. Nonetheless, young vanaras seized by wanderlust may roam far across the world, and travelers from many distant lands may in turn visit vanara communities in search of the wisdom of their elders and sages.</p>\n<p>Vanara culture prizes order and discipline, leading to many vanaras studying monastic practices. They also value compassion, kindness, and community, whether that community is their own or one they're visiting. Most vanaras are quick to offer aid to those in distress and rarely hesitate in the face of evil, no matter the danger it presents. The leaders of vanara villages tend to be religious figures, or occasionally others possessing similar values and experience. Vanaras venerate Ragdya, the Sage of the Mountain, who encourages seeking enlightenment through worldly action and sees the virtues of pranks and humor.</p>",

To avoid persecution, vishkanyas entrench themselves deep into their chosen societies and train in the arts of subtlety. Drawn to work that allows them to put their skills to good use, vishkanyas often take the roles of spy, mercenary, bodyguard, and even assassin. Some of the best-known guilds in the world employ vishkanyas, including the paired Assassins' Guild and Poisoners' Guild of Daggermark in the River Kingdoms, the implacable Red Mantis Assassins, and the famed Grand Sarret academy for courtiers in the Impossible Kingdom of Jalmeray. In most cases, these employers know their employee's true identity, but not always.</p>\n<p>Due to the measures they must take to ensure their survival, vishkanyas don't congregate openly. Instead, they meet in secret, creating support networks and advisory bodies. Leading these gatherings are the most respected of vishkanya women, who work diligently to keep their ancestry and traditions alive. These underground communities are slow to spread, and leaving them means abandoning what little social and cultural support a vishkanya has.

Mostly, these stories are just fictions of fearful minds, but it's true that wayangs were originally creatures of shadow, straddling the edge between light and darkness. The ancestors of modern day wayangs set out on a great exodus some 10,000 years ago, leaving their native Shadow Plane to seek out a new home. On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home. When the light returned, wayangs retreated into what shadowy places they could find, avoiding contact with humans and other peoples of the light, who viewed the small, gaunt beings as suspicious reminders of difficult times.</p>\n<p>Many wayang groups are nomadic, though many other groups have sedentary communities. Some live in homes carved out of natural caves, where they create works of art from stalagmites and other natural features. Others live in treetop villages in rain forests where sunlight barely penetrates the thick canopy of the forest. Wayangs are most populous in southeastern Tian Xia, especially in the archipelago of Minata, also known as the Wandering Isles, but their travels can sometimes take them to even further lands.</p>\n<p>Despite their sinister reputation and secretive nature, wayangs are joyous creatures who tell stories and express their emotions through whisper-singing, dancing, and shadow puppetry, enhancing their performances with shadow magic. Similarly, they weave shadow magic into their deadly fighting styles, but wayangs are not a violent people, usually fighting only to protect what's theirs. Wayangs decorate their stringy hair with beads and their dusky skin with tattooed white dots that form pictures, with each picture silently telling stories about their family's history or their worship of various deities of shadow.</p>",

Usually, these young wollipeds become attached their rancher or parents, but on occasion a few might follow large wild creatures and wander off from their herd. This has led to feral wollipeds around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their domesticated cousins.</p>\n<p>Wollipeds are extremely sturdy, and their docile temperaments make them excellent mounts for those traveling mountain passes. Some mountain settlements have further trained their wollipeds to fight. Battle-ready wollipeds are formidable enemies that pose a threat to even the most experienced of challengers-but even untrained, wollipeds are not defenseless. In addition to their long tusks, they have developed spitting as a way of communication and assault, and readily regurgitate a mixture of stomach acid and the remnants of their last meal to deter predators.</p>\n<p>Few on Golarion realize that these arctic beasts are not native to their world. Wollipeds originated on the planet Triaxus, a world with a magically enhanced eccentric orbit around the same star as Golarion. During the centuries-long Triaxian winters, wollipeds play an integral role in many communities as food, wool, transportation, and even a simple form of companionship. During the equally extended tropical summers, wollipeds retreat to the polar extremes of their world to await the return of the long snows.</p>",

These small, nimble living machines rely on their wits and speed to evade foes and gather information.

Regardless of personal agenda, wyrwoods prioritize the survival of their people above all else, even to the detriment of others when necessary.</p>\n<p>Despite gaining their freedom, wyrwoods struggle to establish a home in Avistan. Some Avistani still view wyrwoods as tools of a secretive cabal, while others consider them traitorous servants who turned on their creators. Fearing for their safety, many wyrwoods fled the Inner Sea region to create a new home in Arcadia. In the coastal city of Segada, wyrwoods live in relative peace and safety, but they still prefer insular lifestyles.</p>\n<p>Given their extreme self-reliance, wyrwoods have learned a degree of adaptability that far surpasses that of other cultures. When a wyrwood community finds itself in need of a specific skill or function, a member of the community-either a volunteer or one selected communally-takes it upon themself to learn the required abilities. They don't view any task as lesser or demeaning, as hubris is foreign to a wyrwood's construct nature.</p>\n<p>A wyrwood's soul is tied to the magical stone that serves as their heart, which sometimes survives even when their construct body perishes.

They most notably feature a pungent stench caused by bodily secretions building up within their thick, shaggy pelts-a stench so strong that yzobu herds can often be smelled before they appear. Territorial and aggressive, yzobus often attack other creatures on sight. When threatened, a herd launches into a stampede, trampling any in their path and goring survivors with their distinctive horns.</p>\n<p>Some ranchers trade yzobu hides as a workable leather for mercenaries and guards, but the powerful smell means that most ranchers tend their small herds on the outskirts of towns. Typically, yzobus aren't raised to a specific age, but rather are killed whenever one escapes and poses a threat. The hides require an intensive tanning process with almost constant brushing and hours soaking in salt water-but the effort results in a leather both soft to the touch and sturdy enough to work as an effective armor for several years.</p>\n<p>Hides aren't the only yzobu products worth harvesting. A female yzobu's milk is rich and nutrient-rich, making it a staple food source in some regions. Their meat is less enticing but still edible.</p>\n<p>These beasts remain a permanent part of hobgoblin society, where their aggressive temperaments and durable, sturdy bodies are great assets. Hobgoblins possess an immunity to yzobu stench, and they view the fact that other races sickened by it as further evidence of their own superiority. They also highly prize yzobu mounts, and hobgoblin commanders often paint their yzobu's horns in varying colors and patterns to show how many enemies the mount has killed. Yzobu cavalry are a staple of hobgoblin military action, and they played a key role in the recent Ironfang Invasion that led to the formation of the new hobgoblin nation of Oprak in Avistan. The establishment of Oprak meant that many Avistani who had never encountered yzobus before have grown familiar-if not enchanted-with their distinctive odor.</p>",

The worst fate that can befall the proprietor of a mountain hot spring is the arrival of a zetogeki, which can transform a lucrative business into a public hazard overnight. Mountain dwellers who make use of such hot springs pay monster hunters handsomely to eradicate or chase off zetogekis, but dealing with the stubborn beasts is no mean feat.</p>\n<p>Even in wilder lands, zetogekis prove menacing to mountaineers. The lizards sometimes purposefully throw themselves down mountainsides to absorb the kinetic energy dealt to them during their tumble. They use this accumulated energy to take down predators-though zetogekis see nearly every other type of creature as a predator.</p>\n<p>This marvelous ability to absorb and dole out physical energy come from a zetogeki's unique configuration of shale-like scales, which it can angle at will much like a porcupine extending its quills. Those who encounter a zetogeki hunkered down with its scales in the telltale raised pattern of zig-zagging black and gold would do well to give the lizard a wide berth.
