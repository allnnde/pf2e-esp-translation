      "publicNotes": "<p>The ahuizotl is a vicious, semi-aquatic predator that resembles a hideous cross between a badger and an otter, with disturbingly web-fingered paws supplemented by a fifth hand at the end of a long, serpentine tail. A clever and stealthy hunter, the ahuizotl lures unwary prey to their doom by mimicking the cries of people in distress. The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility-the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>",

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>The assassin vine is a carnivorous plant with a voracious appetite. Rather than consuming creatures directly, it creates its own fertilizer by entangling prey and squeezing the life from it. Once the plant has killed a creature, it pulls the carcass over to its roots to feed from the decaying flesh. Although an assassin vine lacks eyes, it can detect and track prey through a combination of using its root systems to detect vibrations through topsoil and its leaves to detect heat changes in the vicinity. Although the assassin vine has no real intelligence, its learned behaviors mimic those of cunning ambush hunters.</p>\n<p>As it is slow moving, the assassin vine typically remains rooted in a single area for as long as it has sufficient prey. Though most often found along woodland trails or swamps, these plants can also be encountered in more rural settlements, poorly tended fields, and vineyards. While assassin vines can't be trained in the classical sense, they can be used as defenses, and woodland-dwelling creatures like goblins and fey have been known to cultivate assassin vines as guardians for less-used routes into their lairs. In such cases, the tenders often seek to make the path more obvious than its disuse would otherwise suggest, while simultaneously working to ensure the bones of the vines' victims are removed to keep their presence a secret, resulting in what appears to be an easy approach to the den but is actually an organic ambush.</p>\n<p>Mature assassin vines grow to 20 feet long and have smaller vines extending off the main trunk that reach from to 5 to 10 feet in length. The smallest of these vines sprout every 6 inches or so; they tend to grow clusters of full leaves and occasionally bear small berries. A recently fed assassin vine can have bunches of plump, blood-red berries that are juicy and tart but leave a slightly unpleasant iron aftertaste, as if from the faint taste of blood from a bitten lip.</p>",

An athach does not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of settled territories until they find a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes on a final rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature they can find.

Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.</p>\n<p>Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.</p>\n<p>It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as \"raid frogs,\" placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls. Neither duergars nor drow take good care of the captive creatures, so blindheims rarely last long in captivity.</p>",

Yet their intelligent eyes and the blue nimbus of energy that dances across their fur hint at not only the blink dog's inherent intelligence, but also of their connection to the occult energies and mysteries that hide beyond the sight of the untrained eye. These honorable creatures are as intelligent as most humanoids. They live and hunt in large packs, roaming forests, plains, and the hidden places of the world in hunt for evil creatures-particularly those that dwell in the depths of the Ethereal Plane.</p>\n<p>Unless acting in concert with specific allies who have proven that their goals are shared, blink dogs tend to avoid other creatures if at all possible. Their packs are constantly on the move and hidden from those that would seek them out. But in times of need, they have been known to come to the rescue of villages and lost travelers. While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.</p>\n<p>Pack leadership always falls to a pair-an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.</p>",

Often attired in clothes that appear to be made of plants or leaves, brownies wear belts lined with pouches and tools. Whatever language they choose to speak is often is riddled with odd pronunciations and colloquialisms. Their manner of speaking might call upon turns of phrase that are decades or even centuries out of vogue, for example, or they might mix up their metaphors in strange ways. It almost seems as if brownies adopt these quirky ways of speaking intentionally-certainly they do not react favorably to corrections to their chatter. There's often no swifter way to annoy a brownie than to try to correct its grammar. Brownies stand barely 2 feet tall and weigh about 20 pounds.</p>\n<p>When facing danger, brownies rarely engage in combat, preferring instead to confound and confuse their attackers in order to buy enough time for escape. Content with honest toil and the love of their kin, brownies maintain a pacifist nature, harassing creatures only to run them off or punish them for an insult. Despite this nature, all brownies carry a blade. They refer to their swords with a hint of disgust, and jokingly call their blades their \"final trick,\" reserving their use for the direst of circumstances.</p>\n<p>Honest to a fault, brownies take freely but always repay their debt through work or leave something behind as an offering. They may eat an apple from a farmer's orchard but harvest the entire tree as repayment. A brownie might eat an entire pie left on a windowsill, only to straighten up the kitchen or wash the dishes. A brownie can share a home with a family for years and years while avoiding detection. A family that is aware of a brownie in their midst usually finds this a beneficial relationship and leaves dishes of milk, pieces of fruit, trinkets, and sometimes even wine as gifts. In exchange, the resident brownie keeps the home clean, mends clothes, repairs tools, and shoos away vermin and small predators. Bragging about having a brownie in the house is the best way to lose one. Brownies distrust foxes and fear wolves, and they avoid farms with dogs.</p>",

A choker typically strangles its prey to death, then drags the body off or dismembers it using crude tools if the body is too big to carry. If confronted or outnumbered, a choker tries to escape, often compressing into a tight passage to get away. Chokers that encounter humanoids exhibit intense curiosity about their culture, society, and the products of art and industry. This interest isn't very deep-it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.</p>\n<p>Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt-a wandering pet, a person who is out alone-might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.</p>",

The smaller pair of arms are reserved for fine manipulations and are not effective in combat.</p>\n<p>D'ziriaks' otherwise dull brown carapaces are decorated with numerous runes glowing in bright colors. These tattoo-like runes indicate an individual's role in d'ziriak society, and set them apart from their home plane's other native inhabitants. The runes glow with natural bioluminescence, and d'ziriaks can make them flare brightly for an instant, at the expense of overstressing the biochemical glands that create and maintain the runes for an extended time. The color and shape of the runes are partially natural, but can be shaped and customized carefully over time to fit the individual's station. The D'ziriak language is a mix of buzzes and chitters, and is spoken by few other creatures. D'ziriaks prefer to communicate with other species using telepathy rather than endure the sound of their language being \"butchered by fleshy throats.\" D'ziriaks organize into hive cities led by a king and queen. These hive cities consist of impressive spires, yet these towers are only the foremost part of the settlement, with many more chambers reaching deep below for residences, workshops, and fungus farms. D'ziriak settlements are lit inside and out with alchemical and magical light sources, often in the shapes of runes. These dimly glowing towers provide travelers with landmarks, and perhaps promise safe havens, on the otherwise gloomy Shadow Plane.</p>",

An elasmosaurus is 30 feet long and weighs 6,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>As rare and reclusive as they are, elasmosauruses are sometimes mistaken for even rarer creatures called water orms, legendary aquatic denizens of remote lakes known for their elusiveness and craftiness. Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers. As a result, it's theorized that a typical water orm is more than happy to lead a group of spectators to a lost elasmosaurus, both to throw its pursuers off its tail and for the hilarity that will inevitably ensue.</p>\n<p>While elasmosauruses are often found in lost worlds and unsettled regions, those who dwell in the oceans of the world do not contain their hunting grounds to specific regions. As a result, it's not unheard of for a wandering specimen to find its way to coastal waters. Those that do often find the ports of small towns or even large cities to be wondrous banquets and are usually hunted down by coastal guards or adventurers.

In regions ruled by infernal powers, evangelists may serve as lieutenants or advisors, whispering secret paths to power in exchange for mortal's souls or choice mortal flesh.

They transcend their stoic detachment only when inflicting pain and terror upon their victims, practicing new forms of torture, or when turning their agonizing practices back on themselves. Velstracs consider themselves enlightened beings, transcending such limitations as morality or mortal taboos, but their victims know them as emotionless tormentors who inflict sadistic suffering. These fiends claim to seek perfection in thought, form, and action, although they don't recognize any refinement that doesn't require the painful excision of the flesh or spirit.</p>\n<p>Velstracs manifest from the souls of the most extreme masochistic or sadistic mortals who are judged and sent on to the Shadow Plane.

Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance.</p>\n<p>Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some.</p>\n<p>Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.</p>",

Giant slugs are always voracious and prefer to eat flesh or plants high in water content. They frequently consume livestock or strip bare entire orchards or melon crops. For cattle, pigs, or other sizable meals, they first shred the creatures using their radula-tongue-like appendages covered in teeth- to make them easier to consume. The mucus secreted by a giant slug is powerfully acidic and viscous. Wherever it travels, the creature leaves a trailing brown strip that kills most vegetation. Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.</p>\n<p>Giant slugs tend to travel at night, as the creatures dislike sunlight and dry weather. They have been known to seek out locations like barns, the undersides of bridges, or even fortifications like castles for shelter as dawn starts to break. Woe to the unprepared farmer who ambles out at sunrise to milk the cows but instead finds that a giant slug has made the barn its home! Subterranean giant slugs don't have to worry about sunlight, and crawl about on no schedule in particular. Narrow tunnels pose little obstacle for them, as the creatures can easily compress their bodies. These factors make their movements very unpredictable, so they pose quite a menace for underground peoples like kobolds or xulgaths.</p>",

In battle, gorgons use their petrifying breath to turn their prey into stone. They break up the resulting statues with their hooves or horns and swallow the stony chunks with loud chewing bites.

Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these \"pets\" poorly at best.</p>\n<p>There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey-for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping.</p>\n<p>Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.</p>",

These frog-like humanoids are uniquely adapted to their environment, with oversized eyes that give them keen vision in both light and dark and large toes that allow them to easily scale trees. Gripplis vary widely in physical appearance, with their physiologies influenced by their surrounding environment. Those who live in verdant forests, for example, typically have bright green skin and red eyes. In contrast, gripplis who live in regions of rot and decay have mottled-brown coloration, and those who dwell near lakes or streams may bear bright blue and orange stripes. Typical gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and weigh approximately 30 pounds.</p>\n<p>Whatever region they come from, gripplis tend to be peaceful hunter-gatherers. Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes.</p>\n<p>Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk. They make use of broad leaves and thick branches to further obscure their villages, making them especially difficult to spot from the forest floor, and riddle the surrounding forest with labyrinthine trails that only they can navigate.</p>\n<p>Grippli scouts typically keep watch on the outskirts of grippli settlements. More potent gripplis inhabit the settlements, be they religious leaders, powerful druids, or agile warriors that, due to their small size, focus more on finesse weapons and ranged attacks than on melee tactics.</p>",

Gastroliths are fragile and explode on contact, spraying the area with shards of rock and caustic acid.</p>\n<p>While one might easily mistake an irlgaunt for a simple brutish beast, they have a keen intelligence and use devious hunting strategies. They set traps for travelers and are fond of using gems and magical items taken from previous victims as bait.

They also use their gastroliths to direct the movements of their prey, forcing victims into dead ends at the edge of chasms or cliffs.</p>\n<p>For the most part, irlgaunts live solitary lives, likely because finding enough food to sustain a community tends to be difficult.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.</p>\n<p>Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.</p>\n<p>Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization-the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better!</p>\n<p>The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it-nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.</p>\n<p>Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.</p>\n<p>Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.</p>\n<p>Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.</p>\n<p>Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.</p>",

The leprechaun most often returns such stolen prizes just in time to defuse tensions, often as they point out the humor of the situation, hoping to share their amusement and mirth with the victim. In cases where a leprechaun's trick goes too far and results in an incensed victim, the leprechaun quickly flees the conflict rather than engage in combat. This willingness to return stolen goods or to flee from battles fades as leprechauns grow older. Ancient leprechauns who have lived for thousands of years often spiral into dark bitterness and increasingly use their powers and illusions to lure those who offend them or fail to appreciate a joke into danger... or even death.</p>",

Whereas naiads have more patience and often seek to educate the ignorant regarding the harm that stereotypes can cause, nereids and rusalkas have little patience for such methods. Rusalkas are the primary source for the legends of fey preying upon sailors, and nereids loathe them for that, as they prefer to live apart from humanity and enjoy the beauty of the natural world in peace.</p>\n<p>When a nereid learns of a rusalka's increased activity, it often seeks out the rusalka to route them-not so much out of an urge to protect humanoids (in whom nereids traditionally have little interest), but to prevent the rusalka from inadvertently riling up violent responses from humanoids who can't be bothered to note the difference between a murderous fey and one who just wants to be left alone.</p>",

Nixies tend to be reclusive and try to keep their presence hidden from humanoids, hoping trespassers won't give them cause to act. Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home.</p>\n<p>Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. If this task is underwater, nixies use their magic to temporarily grant the ability to breathe water to the charmed creature. Only those who manage to befriend a nixie are given invitations to return to swim or dine with the fey, and only the most trusted of allies are granted a minor wish.</p>\n<p>Nixies appear as aquatic humanoids the size of a child, with large eyes, catfish-like whiskers, and webbed fingers and toes. They have scaly skin, pointed ears, and long hair the color of seaweed. Nixies often form small communities, even building underwater societies if their numbers are great enough. In many cultures' folklore, there are stories of nixie nations hidden at the bottom of particularly large lakes.</p>",

These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else.</p>\n<p>Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating ritual is short and violent. Female perytons generally abandon their eggs after laying them, so newly hatched perytons must fend for themselves from the moment they emerge.</p>\n<p>A lone peryton typically builds a nest in a rocky overhang or an exceptionally tall and strong tree where they can observe nearby lands. Although they aren't particularly interested in wealth, perytons do like to collect small objects from their victims.

Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an extra dimension of flavor to the meal.</p>\n<p>Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that they don't need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.</p>\n<p>Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than being hacked to pieces.</p>",

While this poison simply rots away the flesh of most creatures, one of these specially prepared bats will immediately rise from death as a skaveling after succumbing to its effects.</p>\n<p>Despite its tattered wings and sagging skin, a skaveling is more than capable of flight, even when carrying a creature mounted on its back-urdefhans often use skavelings as mounts in this way. Their intelligence is more advanced than that of the typical giant bat, and in combat they function more as allies than as mere mounts, capable of making their own tactical decisions. Yet even though they can reason and think, skavelings remain loyal to the urdefhans who created them, and they never take actions in a fight that would knowingly put their masters in harm's way.</p>",

A fringe of brightly colored feathers circles their bodies, and long tendrils trail from their center, each ending in a snapping beak. Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below.</p>\n<p>Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home. Yet even skrik nettles who find themselves marooned beyond the First World for years never lose their longing for home, and they instinctively seek out portals to this plane for the rest of their lives.</p>",

They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long.</p>\n<p>Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-lasting leadership roles.</p>\n<p>A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims. More than one band of skulks has accidentally engineered its own doom after throwing caution to the wind and exposing its existence to the authorities in an ill-planned but violently passionate attempt to track down such an exile.</p>",

Attempts by giants to capture spinosauruses to serve as guardians typically go poorly, for these headstrong dinosaurs do not domesticate well. Their surly attitudes and striking appearances make them better suited for bloodsports, and they are popular prizes for those who run arenas specializing in battles that pit gladiators against hungry animals or beasts. Of course, an angry dinosaur forced to fight for the amusement of others won't discriminate between potential meals on the battleground and ones seated in the surrounding stands.</p>\n<p>The spinosaurus's appearance and strength make it attractive to more than just giants and bloodsport organizers.

These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks.

When collected, neutralized, and refined, the digestive fluids of a tendriculos form a lacquer that retains some of the tendriculos's acid resistance.</p>\n<p>A tendriculos comes into being with a rudimentary understanding of the Sylvan language, but in some cases it might manifest knowing a different tongue, such as Aklo, Draconic, or even Necril. Regardless, tendriculoses have little patience for chattering from potential meals, though some determined fey and primal spellcasters have been known to form alliances or even closer bonds with tendriculoses. Befriending a tendriculos requires great patience and plentiful food-and these the gifts of food must be alive when handed over.</p>\n<p>When it has finished feeding and is out of combat, a tendriculos slips into a quiescent state for a full day, one of the few times it is safe to approach. Upon rousing, it seeks the deep forest to regurgitate the less digestible portions of its meal. These remains may contain valuables that survived digestion and indicate that a tendriculos's hunting grounds lie nearby.</p>\n<p>Tendriculoses dwell in deep woods and jungles. Those too near populated areas soon draw unwanted attention with their ravenous appetites. Well-fed tendriculoses develop fruiting bodies that cast forth millions of spores.

Their amphibious nature shows in the webbing between the digits of their feet and hands, as well as the fact that they have both gills and a human-shaped nose and mouth. Triton hair grows in wide strands like seagrass, commonly green in shade but in some cases blue or white. Their eyes range in color from sea blue to golden.</p>\n<p>Many tritons see themselves as defenders of the deep, dedicating their lives to protecting the inhabitants of the seas from evil creatures and intruders-whether they come from underwater or the surface world. Primary among triton foes are sea devils and alghollthu, both of whom have amphibious forces that tritons have had to fight underwater and on land.</p>\n<p>In their quest to fight underwater evil, tritons sometimes ally with dolphins and sea turtles (both of which make excellent mounts), water elemental, and sometimes even sharks and sea serpents. Tritons can summon such allies using a conch shell as a trumpet. When it comes to other intelligent undersea species, however, tritons take pride in their self-sufficiency, rarely trading with other underwater peoples such as merfolk, and even more rarely forming established alliances.</p>\n<p>Tritons live in natural-grown villages on the sea floor, forging dwellings out of colorful coral reefs, in rift valleys heated by volcanic activity, and even in underwater canyons- though they avoid settling in extreme depths due to the risk of encountering krakens or worse. They like to decorate their homes with aquatic plants, bioluminescent fish, and attractive trinkets recovered from shipwrecks.</p>",

Requiring vast quantities of meat to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds prowl the foothills of regions where trolls dwell, their voracious hunger driving them to slaughter and consume any prey they encounter. In some regions, trolls breed trollhounds as pets, utilizing the trollhounds' keen sense of smell to aid in the hunt.</p>\n<p>Covered in fetid, weeping sores, trollhounds are carriers of a debilitating contagion known as bloodfire fever. Creatures that contract the disease through the bite of a trollhound experience deep internal pain, as if their blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscle coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Other than suffering from skin irritation, both trolls and trollhounds are immune to the major effects of the disease.</p>\n<p>Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts don't recognize the danger it represents. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds; canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a supposedly slain trollhound, for their regenerative powers are potent indeed.</p>\n<p>While trolls themselves have had great success in domesticating, training, and even befriending trollhounds, the same cannot be said for other would-be masters. Whether impeded by constant exposure to trollhounds' diseased slobber, their ravenous hunger that never seems to be fully sated, or simply their foul personality and quick-to-bite temperament, most attempts to use trollhounds in place of more reliable guardians end in pain, misery, and a pack of feral trollhounds escaping into the hinterlands. Left to their own devices, a pack of escaped trollhounds can breed relatively quickly, and it can take less than a year for a small pack to multiply into a significant threat to the countryside. Best to leave the trollhounds to the trolls, as they say!</p>",

A twigjack's body is made up of prickly brambles woven with vines. Shaggy, mossy growth, not unlike hair, tops a twigjack's head. Its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body. Many dense forests on Golarion have at least a handful of twigjacks living in the undergrowth.</p>\n<p>While truculent and violent, twigjacks care deeply for what they consider to be their forests. These creatures harass outsiders who delve deep into their wooded domains, forcing back even the most determined explorers, foresters, and travelers, especially when those intruders cut roads through the forest. However, they are not terribly territorial when it comes to other forest creatures. When sylvan creatures, especially fey, rally against an outside threat, twigjacks in the area eagerly arrive to fight, even if they were not invited.</p>\n<p>Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage-often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among. Several popular comic songs weave the tale of a twigjack attempting to woo a powerful and graceful dryad, only to be comically disgraced after many loutish attempts. Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes.</p>\n<p>While twigjacks are fey, and as such are often found in the First World, it's somewhat curious that those twigjacks who find religion only rarely turn to the Eldest of the First World. Instead, twigjacks tend to worship false deities of their own design: figures spotted in tangles of tree branches, clots of undergrowth, or other hidden nooks in the natural world. These religions are always highly localized, and while these faiths do not support clerics, they often inspire zealous crusades against non-fey.</p>",

Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei-the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World-have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities.</p>\n<p>Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs.

Still, they prefer to lair near the fringes of such areas, as a vampiric mist needs a constant supply of fresh blood for sustenance. While blood drawn from animals is just as nutritious as blood from anything else, these sadistic monsters vastly prefer the flavor of blood drawn from thinking creatures. Like will-o'-wisps, vampiric mists find that fear flavors the blood, though they gain no particular advantage by feeding on the frightened.</p>\n<p>Although somewhat intelligent, vampiric mists do not form societies. They sometimes group into small gangs, but even then they show little interest in working together. Vampiric mists spend most of their time seeking prey-a pursuit they approach with great creativity. The mists' propensity for taking on vague, skeletal forms of the creatures whose blood they drink further adds to their mystique and fuels rumors that they have connections to the undead. Indeed, many vampiric mists enjoy using this common misconception to their advantage, leading foes to apply foolish tactics-such as tricking spellcasters into attempting to use vitality energy against them as if they were undead monsters.</p>",

Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.</p>\n<p>Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.</p>\n<p>The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims.</p>\n<p>A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal.</p>\n<p>The name \"void zombie\" is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included \"void dead,\" \"akata spawn,\" or \"bloodwalker,\" but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed.</p>\n<p>The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two- after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous. The fact that a void zombie, unlike a yellow musk thrall, is actually undead may hold some clues as to the source of this strange behavior.</p>",

Some claim that water orms are an offshoot of sea serpents and linnorms, but no credible link between these creatures has been found.</p>\n<p>Water orms have many features that sea serpents do not, such as the ability to understand the rudiments of language. Their natural inclination to avoid contact and remain hidden often remains at odds with their equally compelling curiosity about those they might spy upon the shores of their lakes. Water orm sightings usually occur when they can't help but to rise up to the surface to take a peek at someone particularly unusual on the beach or floating on the water's surface.</p>\n<p>These creatures are extremely long-lived and can go for decades, or even centuries, with very little to eat. This allows water orms to subsist in lakes without surfacing for many years, even in bodies of fresh water without ample food sources. Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.</p>\n<p>While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.</p>",

Their hands have three evenly sized and spaced digits in a tripod-like arrangement. When not trying to blend in with the local community, witchwyrds favor outlandish, loose-fitting clothes in bright reds or yellows and a signature conical hat. They tend to prefer the driest, warmest regions of the lands they visit-perhaps an indicator of their mysterious home world. This, however, is the only indicator; witchwyrds are notoriously close-mouthed about details of this distant world, and with good reason: most witchwyrds on Golarion have never visited their ancestral home. To these witchwyrds, the notion of a home planet is a constant thorn in their side, and when asked, many choose to ignore the question altogether. Others are so agitated by these queries that they respond with impatience or even violence. Some scholars have theorized a connection between witchwyrds and several other four-armed creatures, but like with questions of their place of origin, witchwyrds have little to say about the topic.</p>",

Yeth hound packs can number as many as a dozen members, each working in uncanny communion with its packmates to corner and kill their prey. Yeth hounds like to drag their victims back to their lairs to eat at their leisure, so these lairs often contain discarded treasures from the hounds' previous meals.</p>\n<p>Yeth hounds despise two things: sunlight and other canines. They hunt only at night if they can, often breaking off their hunt at dawn to retreat to a subterranean lair or den, no matter how close they had come to catching their prey. Yeth hounds usually attack wargs, wolves, and similar creatures on sight, working to drive larger or more powerful canines from their hunting areas when then can't simply overpower and kill them.</p>\n<p>Evil rangers, bestial demons, and wicked cults are frequently gifted yeth hound servants by fiendish patrons.
