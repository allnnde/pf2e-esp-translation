Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>",

Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin.

It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge,\" possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge,\" comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.</p>\n<p>A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings. When gorged with blood, the creature becomes bloated and pink, and it tends to wobble unsteadily in the air as it flies off to digest its meal.</p>",

A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure.

Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship.

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above-at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname \"landshark.\"</p>\n<p>A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.</p>\n<p>The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf-a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.</p>",

Found in freshwater inlets or saltwater coves worldwide, bunyips hunt where prey is plentiful, often to the consternation of coastal residents and fisherfolk.</p>\n<p>Despite their outlandish appearance and tendency to defend their territory with loud, bellowing roars that echo for great distances, bunyips are very rarely sighted by humanoids, leaving many to question their existence. For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.</p>\n<p>In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.</p>",

They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes-particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters-changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation.</p>\n<p>But there are exceptions.

In combat, a dandasuka might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rakshasas are evil spirits that cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those they seek to defile, rakshasas gorge themselves on these hideous acts. A wide range of rakshasas exist; presented below are the diminutive, sinister dandasuka rakshasa and the infamous raja rakshasa, who are the most widespread and commonly encountered of these fiends.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Dark nagas are wicked, jealous creatures that crave power and wealth. Indeed, the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must be eliminated.</p>\n<p>Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga's lair typically find themselves as the naga's slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster's poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>",

      "name": "Demilich",
      "hpDetails": "void healing",
      "publicNotes": "<p>Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its phylactery. As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Void energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.</p>\n<p>Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families.</p>\n<p>Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures.

The drakauthix's digestive process is entirely external-it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded.

When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace.

      "publicNotes": "<p>The first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p>\n<p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping. Though the fleshwarping process was not created by the drow, many believe they perfected it. The drow torture their enemies in vats of churning magical reagents, reshaping their flesh and psyche alike into horrid and monstrous things. The reconstitution of flesh results in countless variations of fleshwarps, and the following are just a couple of examples of these horrors.</p>",

From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works through the creature's system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal enemies.</p>\n<p>Ether spiders are not mindless or evil-they are simply hungry. If a prospective meal can sate an ether spider's incredible appetite through other means, they might be able to bargain for their life.

Rather, the first priority for most creatures during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins' notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one-ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin's two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn't dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of their life as their own self.</p>\n<p>Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings-although most interlocutors simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway.

Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

With a nominal intelligence, gibbering mouthers can understand and even speak Aklo, but they do so in an intelligible manner only rarely. Instead, their innumerable mouths constantly jabber and babble in a stream of sound that disrupts the thought patterns of other creatures in the area.</p>\n<p>Where, how, and why gibbering mouthers originated are questions without answers. They share certain similarities with the much more powerful shoggoths, leading to theories that the two creatures share an origin; less charitable scholars have suggested that the gibbering mouther is instead a mortal's attempt to create something akin to a shoggoth-though the question of why remains unanswered. Still others believe gibbering mouthers were sent to the world by the gods as a punishment for some forgotten but surely terrible transgression. Gibbering mouthers themselves have little to say on the matter-at least, not in any sort of sense. Scholars have wasted countless hours in attempts to make sense of gibbering mouthers' noises-studies that put researchers into danger and give results that are contradictory and confusing at best.</p>\n<p>Whatever their origin, gibbering mouthers range the entirety of Golarion. Sightings have been recorded in dungeons below ancient cities and ruins as well as many regions of the deeper Darklands layers of Sekamina and Orv.

Demons are living incarnations of sin-be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there joining other fiends as yet another of that plane's horrors. As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations-feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Barghests are lupine fiends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago, barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests' loyalties and philosophical nature changed significantly. Today, while barghests retain their connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",

Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>",

These monstrous brutes are covered with shaggy black fur, often crusted with blood and gore.</p>\n<p>Although gugs may seem bestial, they have keen and wicked intellects. Gugs lair far underground, but they sometimes come to the surface to hunt during dark nights, either alone or in small groups. As they possess voracious appetites, most gugs consume the creatures they catch, but some instead kidnap their victims and retreat below the surface, leaving only a lingering stench and odd, clawed paw-prints. Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares. Dire rumors tell of lightless gug cities made of titanic blocks of stone far underground, where powerful gug leaders preach their vile doctrines to mobs of howling gugs.</p>\n<p>Gugs have a strange relationship with ghouls, which seems to date from their shared origin in a distant subterranean world. Gugs live in fear of ghouls, despite towering over them; however, this strange fear doesn't apply to ghasts, whom gugs consume as voraciously as they do other creatures.</p>\n<p>Gugs stand 16 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds, although they have an eerie, graceful gait that belies their immense size. Their light step and ability to squeeze through very small crannies makes gugs common bogeymen in tales of strange disappearances or bloody massacres.</p>\n<p>Some particularly bloodthirsty gugs gain awful powers as gifts from their eldritch patrons. These monsters are known as savants, are never less than 12th level in power, and gain several occult innate spells. Though each savant's precise mix of spells varies, normally, these spells grant invisibility, offer power to manipulate and change rock, or invoke awful and destructive energies upon living flesh.</p>",

Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don't rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren't destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others-they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons' war against imbalance-particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.</p>\n<p>Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the \"Convergence.\" At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons-but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How-or if-this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.</p>",

This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.</p>\n<p>Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien-perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling-and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher's suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes-only unquestioned fact.</p>\n<p>Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.</p>\n<p>Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals-or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.</p>\n<p>As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",

Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims die before even knowing what attacked them.</p>\n<p>Those who survive the worm's initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh-all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz's internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz's intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons. The giants also employ the worms as war beasts, using them to undermine enemy positions.</p>",

Particularly interested in the philosophy of life and death and the flner points of the more cruel and sinister religions of the world, a roper can talk or argue for hours with those it initially sought merely to eat. Quick-thinking spelunkers can sometimes stave off a roper's appetite by entertaining it with stories or discussions of philosophy, but ropers do not willingly allow such intriguing prey to escape alive. Stories speak of particularly skilled debaters and philosophers who have been kept for days or even years as pets or conversational companions by roper clusters, but in the end, if such pets don't eventually escape, the ropers' appetites win out over their intellectual curiosity-especially in cases where the pets constantly outmaneuver their keepers' wits and patience.

When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the first suspects.</p>\n<p>Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves \"sahuagin\" but have wholly embraced their enemies' name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.</p>\n<p>Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from the ranks. Every pup is given a fair chance, however, and even the lowest-born sea devil can strive for the rank of commander, general, or perhaps even king or queen. Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest, most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own. The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling attempts at their positions via manufactured blood feuds and wars against their numerous enemies ashore and underwater.</p>",

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.</p>\n<p>Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and inflict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.</p>",

Shoggoths exist, yet they tend keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins, emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.</p>\n<p>The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.</p>\n<p>A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.</p>\n<p>Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.</p>",

Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.</p>\n<p>Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.</p>",

At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and enjoyed significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species' name, instead using the epithet their foes gave them: \"skum.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or granite. They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the golems' functionality.</p>\n<p>Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size-most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth's body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.</p>\n<p>Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth's creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune's close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas's many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth's description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.</p>",

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",
