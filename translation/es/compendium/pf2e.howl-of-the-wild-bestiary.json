Though it shares this trait with the docile unicorn, that's where their similarities end. Almirajes are vicious creatures, known to slaughter much larger cattle and, in times of desperation, people. Its stare is said to send even the bravest warrior running for their life.</p>\n<p>Unlike common hares, almirajes are solitary and intensely territorial. They're adaptable ambush hunters with the stamina and speed to chase down any prey. They attack with their jaws and claws but are primarily known for trying to gut their prey with a vicious stab from their horn. Many scholars believe that the terrifying magical aura the creatures exude originates from their horns. This line of thinking has led to an increase in almiraj attacks as local citizens try to capture the creature alive and remove the horn, hoping this will turn it into a more docile hare. These hopes have not proven fruitful, as an almiraj is just as aggressive, if not more so, after their horn has been removed.</p>\n<p>Adventurers often think themselves lucky if they manage to avoid the terrifying horn of this ferocious predator, but it's a much better alternative than being caught in its jaws. Almirajes have a nasty habit of grabbing their prey and vigorously shaking them until they go limp. If this fails, they'll drag their prey underground until they suffocate deep in the earth. Few have ever escaped the burrow of an almiraj.</p>",

Depending on the precise diet of the apothecary bees, they can produce a wide variety of potions, storing any excess in the waxy cells lining their nest. Apothecary bee workers are about a foot long, with yellow and black stripes. While carrying a potion, the bee's abdomen visibly swells and often changes color to match the potion within.</p>\n<p>The value of the apothecary bees' potions has led to numerous attempts at domestication, a dangerous, expensive dream with both high risks and high rewards. Once a magical garden has been established, apothecary beehives tend to become self-sustaining. Beekeepers can potentially guide their cultivation, but they're no longer necessary for the hive's survival. Some ancient, long-abandoned gardens still grow along the Sphinx River in Osirion, where many apothecary bees prowl for flowers that meet their standards. Upon their most recent dig to the surface, surki communities quickly began the process of \"trading\" with the bees, establishing habitats and using their natural magic sense to better tend the massive fields a large hive needs. Miflits, on the other hand, often end up absorbed into the bees' social structure.</p>\n<p>The potions a hive produces vary from season to season, depending on what flowers are available. Beekeepers have made strides in creating gardens that yield specific potions and have even developed harvesting techniques that increase potion effectiveness. These techniques are valuable, closely guarded secrets, but even defective potions with cursed results have found use among the followers of Calistria and Norgorber.</p>",

However, the primary use of their skin flaps isn't for movement, but digestion. When it rains, flynketts roll up their loose skin, creating a crude sort of kettle in which to catch precipitation. The remarkable creatures' acid combines with the falling water to break down wood, soil, or even rocks into a nutritional stew.

If disturbed, particularly in the middle of feeding, they release clouds of acidic steam. They're also capable of spitting the fluid with deadly accuracy.
