Sometimes called a \"copycorpse,\" an akashti in its true form appears as a skin-covered skeleton with sharp talons on its fingers and tears of blood dripping from its lidless eyes. Its skull appears open like a bowl, and inside nest handfuls of crimson butterflies. When an akashti hides within its manifested body, close investigation can sometimes reveal the truth when the scalp of the supposed beloved one returned to life seems to subtly ripple and bulge as the butterflies within writhe. Akashtis embody the complex cycle of grief.</p>\n<h2>Deathly Invaders</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, akashtis ambush and murder targets not to bask in the grief of their loved ones, but instead to assume their form and infiltrate an organization from within to corrupt established bonds of camaraderie. Inevitably, though, these akashtis grow bored with deception and lead their new allies into a trap for slaughter.</p>",

With each passing year, the feline becomes more and more monstrous—growing in size, becoming more intelligent, and gaining an affinity for magic. Eventually, they become able to walk upright on their rear legs, pursue new hobbies, and learn languages. Despite this expanded intellect, many bakenekos prefer to enjoy the first decades of their ascension continuing their lives as usual as a (particularly oversized) house cat. For some, they do so because they want to acquire knowledge of the world that they couldn't comprehend as cats, but for others, it's just a desire to live out their lives with their current families and loved ones before moving on to what comes next.</p>\n<p>Bakenekos enjoy dancing above all other pleasures and can't resist nodding their heads, tapping their paws, or swishing their tails in time to music. They often animate corpses simply to watch them dance—a pastime that often spells trouble for nearby settlements should the undead get free from the bakeneko's control. Bakenekos typically have a playful and mischievous demeanor, and while they aren't inherently evil creatures, they're still feared for their ability to animate corpses and command fire. Villagers are often frightened half to death by the sight of a flaming cat strolling alongside a walking corpse, and bakenekos' association with evil and the occult has caused some villages in Tian Xia to vilify all cats.</p>\n<h2>Nekomatas</h2>\n<p>Bakenekos mostly see their animated but mindless zombies as amusements, though they also use them as guardians or even as agents for revenge. Still, they do their best to ensure that undead they animate aren't left to wander free. Most tales of \"evil bakenekos\" in fact refer to a similar and much more dangerous creature, the nekomata—a level 6 Medium-sized variant of the bakeneko whose bite causes a debilitating disease of the mind.</p>",

    "Guhdggi": {
      "name": "Guhdggi",
      "publicNotes": "<p>A guhdggi forms from the corrupted reincarnated souls of those who have trod the same pilgrimage route through multiple lives. This type of nindoru looks like a bloated frog with long, slender human arms instead of front feet. Its eyes appear bulbous and blind yet are capable of sight. A guhdggi always carries a large wicker cage strapped to their back, while dozens of cords and straps affix a trove of broken weapons, tools, and items to their belly and flanks. When they walk, they do so with the aid of two long spears clutched in their forearms, stumbling and hopping in an ungainly gait. The most unsettling feature of the guhdggi is its second face, revealed when the frog-like mouth opens to reveal a human face peering from its throat amid a tangled nest of butterflies. This face has long, dark, animated hair capable of inflicting painful lashes, the lengths of which hang from the corner of the frog's mouth when its lips are closed.</p>\n<p>While the guhdggi is no longer capable of movement as swift as most humanoids walk, they still enjoy traveling while harboring a ferocious jealousy of those who can do so with greater ease. One would do well not to underestimate the stumbling stagger of a guhdggi, though! The fiend particularly delights in lying in wait along isolated sections of pilgrimage routes to ambush travelers, trapping victims in their cages and feeding upon their captive's mind and memories of previously visited places.</p>\n<p>Guhdggis embody the cycles of repeated journeys and the concept that every journey taken ends at the start of the next. Central to this concept is the notion that no journey ever truly begins or ends—they just emerge from the previous one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

Born from souls who were once enlightened but then renounced it and their role in the cycle of reincarnation, they curse the futility of their existence and find pleasure in leading others to the same fate.</p>\n<p>Ijdas appear as towering humanoids, their bodies bloated and constantly bursting with small red butterflies that flitter away before melting into mist. Their arms are overly long and so broken as to writhe more like tentacles, affording them an unsettling combat style with greater reach than most large creatures enjoy. They wear clothing and capes made of moldy straw and wield broken swords whose shattered blades still float roughly in place. Their most unsettling features are their complete lack of heads; instead, where a head should be sits a wicker cage filled with a writhing cloud of butterflies. Yet still, they see, hear, and speak without issue, as if their heads remained in place.</p>\n<p>Formed without heads or even brains, an idja's mind is shared among the flocks of butterflies in their head cages or bursting from their bodies, and as each of these insects escapes and fades away, these forgetful fiends lose another potential thought. Unable to learn new things, any actions they take stem from memories etched into their souls or directives they blindly follow from other nindorus or creatures they've come to accept as superiors. Their movements, words, and reactions are all conducted via a type of muscle memory based on how their souls believe they should respond to their external stimuli. As a result, most now serve as brutal guardians, since their forgetfulness also prevents them from being able to sleep.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>When a soul doomed to become a thatchling dies in the throes of great anguish, they can return after death as a red-hooded thatchling. These vengeful thatchlings appear to wear red hoods when viewed at a distance, but up close, the grisly truth—that their heads are blood-soaked—is revealed. Unlike other thatchlings, red-hooded thatchlings are skilled at trickery, and their ability to appear as a living humanoid through illusion magic allows them to lure the unexpected into ambushes much more easily.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In rural Shenmen, some branches of Sangpotshi warn of what can happen if a soul bound for reincarnation is prevented from entering the River of Souls and rejoining the cycle. These souls become frustrated, confused, and then furious at what they feel is a denial of the body they deserve, and in turn, they force vegetation to serve as their new body. Others theorize that when a body is buried in a shallow grave, the roots of grass growing down into the remains can tangle the soul and capture it.</p>\n<p>Thatchlings are intelligent and capable of speaking but rarely do so—they generally have little to say to those whose lives they covet. Rarely, one might attempt to lure someone into an area of tall grass or dense undergrowth by calling out to them for aid, but they have little skill at deception, so such tactics aren't particularly effective at making them seem like actual living creatures in need of help.</p>\n<h2>Old Friends</h2>\n<p>The source of Willowshore's thatchlings is the simple fact that the souls who would normally have been reincarnated upon death can't do so, thus rising as thatchlings. Of course, since each year \"resets\" things, those who died during the year and became thatchlings are reborn alive once more on every first day of summer, with no memories of their previous doomed existence. While still driven by instinct to attack the living, Willowshore's thatchlings do feel a sense of remorse—if the GM judges it especially appropriate, they might take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and saving throws against creatures they knew in life.</p>\n<h2>Forever Senseless</h2>\n<p>The thatchling's curse robs the sense of direction from those it falls upon, leading to a whole category of insults in Shenmen that compare someone's ability to get something done to \"a thatchling's sense.\" For example, someone who has a hard time making friends might be said to have \"a thatchling's sense of friendship,\" while someone who constantly ruins meals might be said to have \"a thatchling's kitchen sense.\"</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>A sojiruh comes into existence when a creature who has dedicated multiple lives to achieving enlightenment turns their back on these goals and deliberately tears themselves away from the cycle of reincarnation before their death. These monstrous creatures are the most common nindoru and are also the most hated by followers of Sangpotshi, since so many of these fiends rise from fallen members of that very philosophy.</p>\n<p>This type of nindoru relishes the flavor of an oft-reincarnated soul and finds this life force tastes best when consumed while the physical body still lives and screams. To sojiruhs, the sound of a perfect scream from the body it feeds upon is akin to the perfect wine pairing with dinner.</p>\n<p>A sojiruh's mouth is stitched shut with lengths of its own hair. Despite this, they can speak freely, their hollow-sounding voices issuing clearly from sealed lips. They only stretch these stitches when they choose to shriek and scream. Their arms are long and broken-looking, while their chests are little more than rib cages filled with red wet butterflies that crawl through and cling to the creature's ribs and organs. When a sojiruh screams, the wings of the butterflies in its chest flutter frantically.</p>\n<p>Sojiruhs symbolize the cycle of reincarnation come undone from its purity and becoming mired in decay and corruption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When an evil mortal soul that has been reincarnated multiple times is wrenched from the cycle of souls and corrupted, it can undergo a horrific transformation into a fiend known as a nindoru. A force for entropy and the breaking of cycles, nindorus are hideous creatures whose bodies often appear distorted, who wield weapons that have been shattered yet still function, and whose true face is often hidden from view. They display traits one might expect to see in an undead creature, such as decaying flesh or exposed bones, yet a nindoru is very much still alive.</p>\n<p>Each nindoru epitomizes the fracture of a specific cycle, be it one from the natural world or from societal traditions. To the nindoru, nothing is more delicious than the consumption of a creature who has reincarnated multiple times, with those who are theoretically about to ascend to true enlightenment presenting the tastiest meal. Those slain by a nindoru are themselves torn from the cycle—the lucky ones move on to the Boneyard for judgment, but many are instead corrupted to form more of these horrific fiends.</p>\n<p>Followers of Sangpotshi find nindoru to be particularly abhorrent and count them among the greatest threats imaginable. Most commonly found in regions of the world where the reincarnation cycle is strongest, nindorus are, like rakshasas and oni, associated most strongly with the Material Plane.</p>\n<h2>Reincarnated Souls</h2>\n<p>In some cases, you'll know if a creature a nindoru attacks has a reincarnated soul. Ancestries like samsarans are always reincarnated souls, and a PC's backstory or even their background can often indicate the presence of a previous life. All of the PCs in Season of Ghosts qualify as reincarnated souls, as they've relived their lives over and over for decades. If you ever need to determine if a creature's soul is reincarnated for the purpose of adjudicating a nindoru's ability, attempt a @Check[flat|dc:11]—on a success, it has a reincarnated soul.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Demigods</h2>\n<p>The most powerful nindorus are demigods, although their cults are quite rare. Prone to reincarnation after death, nindoru demigods like Kugaptee are more properly known as \"nindoru ascetics.\"</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Traitors</h2>\n<p>While most nindorus are purely chaotic evil in nature, legends tell of exceptionally rare nindorus who manage to escape their own nature and ascend, reincarnating after death into kami or other more benevolent spirits and shedding the nindoru trait as they do so. Of course, these \"traitors\" are regarded as the most delicious meals imaginable by the nindorus left behind.</p>\n<h2>Nindoru Butterflies</h2>\n<p>One of the strangest shared traits of the various types of nindoru are the blood-red butterflies that seem to follow them around, nest on their bodies, or periodically emerge from their wounds. These unnerving insects are physical manifestations of the nindorus' thoughts and symbolize the countless past lives they once lived but turned their backs on. Nindoru butterflies never last long once they flutter more than a few feet from their source, fading away into smoke that quickly dissipates into the air.</p>\n<h2>Other Nindorus</h2>\n<p>Many other types of nindorus exist beyond the four presented on these pages. Others include the corpse-copying akashtis (sobbing nindorus), infiltrators of society known as kagekumas (lurking nindorus), the dead defiling shisagishins (crooked nindorus), and the powerful and brutal argyrzeis (headless nindorus).</p>",

These minor undead can't form bodies larger than those of a small human child.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In rural Shenmen, some branches of Sangpotshi warn of what can happen if a soul bound for reincarnation is prevented from entering the River of Souls and rejoining the cycle. These souls become frustrated, confused, and then furious at what they feel is a denial of the body they deserve, and in turn, they force vegetation to serve as their new body. Others theorize that when a body is buried in a shallow grave, the roots of grass growing down into the remains can tangle the soul and capture it.</p>\n<p>Thatchlings are intelligent and capable of speaking but rarely do so—they generally have little to say to those whose lives they covet. Rarely, one might attempt to lure someone into an area of tall grass or dense undergrowth by calling out to them for aid, but they have little skill at deception, so such tactics aren't particularly effective at making them seem like actual living creatures in need of help.</p>\n<h2>Old Friends</h2>\n<p>The source of Willowshore's thatchlings is the simple fact that the souls who would normally have been reincarnated upon death can't do so, thus rising as thatchlings. Of course, since each year \"resets\" things, those who died during the year and became thatchlings are reborn alive once more on every first day of summer, with no memories of their previous doomed existence. While still driven by instinct to attack the living, Willowshore's thatchlings do feel a sense of remorse—if the GM judges it especially appropriate, they might take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack rolls and saving throws against creatures they knew in life.</p>\n<h2>Forever Senseless</h2>\n<p>The thatchling's curse robs the sense of direction from those it falls upon, leading to a whole category of insults in Shenmen that compare someone's ability to get something done to \"a thatchling's sense.\" For example, someone who has a hard time making friends might be said to have \"a thatchling's sense of friendship,\" while someone who constantly ruins meals might be said to have \"a thatchling's kitchen sense.\"</p>",
