Their outgoing charm isn't just for their own entertainment; by engaging with flora and fauna alike, they coax local organisms to interact with each other, whether that's teaching animals how to forage together or introducing vines to new surfaces they can climb. This extends even to travelers and foresters. After all, a lumberjack offered salutations is less likely to scuffle with wildlife and knows someone's watching to ensure they don't overharvest a forest's bounty.</p>\n<p>Azhanas perform some of this gardening themselves. They carry hefty shears, clipping back invasive species and trimming branches to afford new sprouts a taste of sunlight. Likewise, they occasionally visit rural settlements, offering to teach wilderness skills that help civilization and nature coexist peacefully. Those who respond kindly earn an azhana's generosity. Those who threaten nature or fey instead earn the azhana's ire, usually involving magical misfortunes as small animals steal food, tools melt into useless shapes, and roots suddenly shift to send a trespasser tumbling down a ravine.</p>\n<p>Azhanas sometimes gather into small groups called sisterhoods, even if they include rare, non-female azhanas. These groups provide camaraderie and aid in resolving difficult obstacles. Less often, they form organically when an azhana adopts and mentors newborn azhanas. These creatures are never children; instead, they emerge fully formed from mature trees, accompanied by nearby trees thrumming softly in a celebratory chorus. Though any mature tree might suffice, most often an azhana's parent tree stands in some place of primal power or divine significance, such as where a nature deity performed a miracle.</p>\n<h2>Arboreal Friends</h2>\n<p>Azhanas are friends and tenders to the massive arboreals, and are found in the same locations—wooded stands of trees in places of primal power. These two beings don't necessarily live among each other continually, but many azhanas count at least a couple of arboreals among their friend group and visit the living trees to share stories, groom them, or engage in friendly games.</p>",

These are extremely sensitive and seem to anchor some part of an ohancanu's essence, wracking them with nausea and weakness if ever plucked.</p>\n<p>Though they habitually raze wildernesses, ohancanus rely on old growth forests for reproduction. When an ohancanu grows old, their companions murder and dissect them, planting their organs among the roots of the oldest trees around.

From their first moments they understand language and basic survival skills, suggesting each generation retains some portion of their butchered progenitors' memories.</p>\n<h2>Riddles And Rage</h2>\n<p>Ohancanus delight in destroying wordplay almost as much as they love demolishing architecture.

Their speed and agility, as well as a natural intelligence and aptitude for training, have made chetamogs highly sought-after animal companions for those whose travels take them into the depths of the forest, a demand that has been recognized by enterprising ranchers who breed and raise the creatures for precisely this purpose.</p>\n<p>A fully grown chetamog resembles an enormous squirrel, roughly 9 feet long and 5 feet high at the shoulder. Properly trained chetamogs are capable of serving as combat mounts. Few sights can match the glory of chetamog cavalry gliding effortlessly through thick ground cover and striking down a legion of earthbound foes before vanishing back into the treetops with ease.</p>\n<h2>Natural Hoarders</h2>\n<p>Chetamogs have a well-documented proclivity for stealing items and burying them in hidden caches throughout the forest, a majority of which are promptly forgotten and never recovered by the chetamog responsible. Although food items are generally preferred, chetamogs are also fascinated by brightly colored, shiny, and particularly fragrant items of any kind, and numerous tales persist of all manner of strange and valuable treasures being discovered in unexpected locations by fortunate explorers while traveling through chetamog territory.</p>",

      "name": "Durnolith",
      "publicNotes": "<p>When a human, elf, orc, satyr, or other Medium creature is transformed into a woodwarp, they become a durnolith. Sometimes called a \"batterfrill\" by members of the Rootweft Lodge, durnoliths are stocky quadrupedal powerhouses encased in dense wooden plates. While they may look slow and lumbering, their wide-set, muscular legs bear their weight with ease. Durnoliths have a hard bone and wood frill framing their head, which they use both offensively and defensively. Easily angered, durnoliths are prone to charging headlong into a fight, battering and smashing their prey senseless with their armored frill, then clawing their prey to ribbons with their razor-sharp claws.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Woodwarps are mutated monsters created when a sapient creature is flooded with unchecked energy from the Plane of Wood that they're unable to control. This rush of all-consuming planar energy scours the creature from the inside out, subsequently warping them into a monstrous humanoid-plant hybrid—an aberration possessing the physiological features of both, painfully reshaped into something dreadful to behold.</p>\n<p>A woodwarp's form and features are determined by the size of the creature they were before their transformation—thrailorns were Small, and durnoliths were Medium. Regardless of their appearance and form, woodwarps endure constant pain from the dense root network that grows inside of them, piercing bone, muscle, and internal organs. This agonizing, all-consuming pain drives woodwarps to violence, causing them to lash out at everything around them.</p>\n<p>In her quest for ultimate power, Ruzadoya Quickmane devised a ritual to purposefully funnel energy from the Plane of Wood into her followers, transforming them into either a woodwarped monstrosity or an elite woodblessed soldier known as Ruzadoya's Chosen. An elaborate wooden ritual focus carved from Idyllis, a tree from the Plane of Wood, serves as the focus for this ritual and the source of planar energy. During a woodwarp's transformation, this wooden ritual focus fuses to the body and becomes the origin point for the woodwarp's root network. Woodwarps created through such rituals are easier to control than woodwarps created by happenstance, as an experienced ritualist can imprint their will upon a woodwarp during their transformation. Such woodwarps serve Ruzadoya as hunters, sentries, and vicious shock troops.</p>\n<h2>Just A Name</h2>\n<p>While woodwarps have proper names, it's unlikely that members of the Rootweft Lodge will discover them. Instead, the woodwarps are referred to by monikers or nicknames. Thrailorns are dubbed \"thornbacks\" and durnoliths are dubbed \"batterfrills.\"</p>\n<h2>Other Woodwarps</h2>\n<p>Thrailorns and durnoliths are not the only types of woodwarps. Creatures of different sizes result in different woodwarps. Sprites, fey dragonets, jinkins, and other Tiny creatures become izifaines—headless woodwarps with fleshy wings and a sharp stinger shrouded in toxic flower petals. Centaurs, minotaurs, giants, and other Large creatures become rogoars—athletic woodwarps with muscular, elongated arms who wrestle their prey.</p>",

These fey are so rare and so distrustful of one another's company that two have never been seen together; the mistaken assumption that only a single Spring-Heeled Jack exists is therefore entirely understandable. The fact that sightings occur across Ustalav (and beyond) and across centuries of time is ascribed to the trickster's long lifespan and mysterious ability to travel quickly, or to the belief that there's no such creature, merely an urban legend that twisted minds attempt to bring to life through costumes, magic, and a series of murders and mayhem. Even in fear-drenched Ustalav, no one has yet guessed that multiple Spring-Heeled Jacks exist or postulated that some future event might drive them to overcome their mutual disdain and gather into a murderous cabal, far more powerful than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks are cruel-eyed, hairy fey with vaguely humanoid shapes and extra features that cause them to be easily mistaken for demons or devils. Glowing eyes, cloven hooves, menacing horns, and a pointed tail combine to create the mien of a wicked imp; his love of sudden and sadistic violence completes the impression. Almost all have jet-black skin and fur, though a few exceptions might exist.</p>\n<p>Spring-Heeled Jacks typically hide their features in tattered cloaks, appearing as a hunched elder or a youth in the nighttime conditions they enjoy. Such a disguise rarely holds up to any scrutiny, but that doesn't matter much to the Spring-Heeled Jack, who only needs something that offers just enough doubt for their target to move within striking distance, which can be from much farther away than most other creatures even realize. Once close enough, the Spring-Heeled Jack leaps startling distances in the blink of an eye to easily slash at a victim who had, until that moment, considered themself safe.</p>",

Standing 10 feet tall and densely muscled, ogres are usually as strong as they are vicious. The worst ogres are sadists, enjoying remorseless murder, torture, and violence in all of its forms. Although they prefer to vent their violent urges on other humanoids—the smaller the better—ogre captivity can end in a horrifying fate for anyone unlucky enough to fall within their meaty grasp: becoming dinner. But for all their creativity in inflicting pain, ogres often forget that their playthings lack their own robust fortitude and high pain tolerance, and many of their captives die sooner than the ogres might prefer. Meanwhile, those who manage to survive captivity in an ogre's larder often emerge with lasting mental scars. A captive able to keep their wits about them, however, can sometimes trick the brutes by promising treasure, more plentiful food sources, or other crude amusements, taking advantage of an ogre's often-limited intellect to engineer opportunities to escape or gain revenge.</p>\n<p>Ogres are social creatures only in the most debased sense. They gather together in groups called families, though members are not always related by blood. The most powerful ogre in any family is the \"boss\"—usually the family's patriarch or matriarch—whom the other ogres in the family learn to quickly obey or risk being brutalized by the boss's loyal kin. Ogres lair in caves, crumbling ruins, or dilapidated shacks close enough to humanoid settlements or animal trails to make raiding easy.

From their first moments they understand language and basic survival skills, suggesting each generation retains some portion of their butchered progenitors' memories.</p>\n<h2>Riddles And Rage</h2>\n<p>Ohancanus delight in destroying wordplay almost as much as they love demolishing architecture. A clever riddle can captivate an ohancanu and even halt their rampage. However, such a tactic rarely provide more than a brief opportunity for escape; once an ohancanu solves the puzzle or grows frustrated, their destruction resumes.</p>",

These trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security. Trolls are truly creatures of the forest, deeply linked in flesh and blood to the verdant habitats they consider their territory. In fact, when a forest troll is killed, their flesh turns into blackened lumps of charcoal, often still glowing with coals. Despite that, these creatures roam farther and wider than most of their kin, to the extent that they're the first creatures a common person thinks of when they hear the word \"troll.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. The roots of these stories are undoubtedly true. Trolls' flesh endlessly regrows, going so far as to sprout aberrant limbs or additional heads if not pruned, and a bottomless hunger is required to feed such unfettered growth. Even in the process of glutting themselves, however, trolls find opportunities to taunt their prey and inflict petty cruelties.</p>\n<p>A troll's ability to survive is so strong that they believe even the smallest scrap of flesh will slowly regenerate into a new form, suffering as all the powers of the land are gathered to revive them. Despite the pain, trolls speak of this unassailable vitality as a blessing from their creator. Few trolls have heard the laughter of demons who claim that creator cursed the trolls and cast them down from lofty heights, binding them so they could never rise again.</p>\n<p>Trolls prefer to remain solitary, keeping every scrap of food for themselves. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead groups of trolls. Such warleaders possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. This link to their environment is an often misunderstood aspect of trollkind, and grows more acute with a troll's age and power. That's not to say trolls are valorous protectors of nature. They're vicious and territorial, and will blight their own territory forever if it means more to eat for a day.</p>",

Others are created, either purposefully by necromancers or incidentally during magical experiments. Regardless of origin, a putrifer loses much of its intelligence during the transformation, becoming aggressive, erratic, and easily confused. Putrifers act instinctively, often lingering around the places they frequented in life. They find comfort in patterns and usually form simple daily routines that they loathe to deviate from. Often, these routines echo those they performed in life. A putrifer's memories are distant and faded, returning only periodically in short, confusing bursts that drive the putrifer to reenact moments from their past lives. Their inability to reconcile these memories with the present sometimes causes putrifers to destroy the locations they revisit and harm the people they once knew.</p>\n<h2>Returning Memories</h2>\n<p>Over time, a putrifer's memories return, with each bout of remembrance lasting longer and resulting in more vivid, accurate memories.

Sometimes called a \"thornback\" by members of the Rootweft Lodge, thrailorns are nimble and strong with a muscular, compact body. Their torso is coiled in thorny branches and growths that sprout long, barbed thorns. These thorns cause deep puncture wounds and can become embedded in the flesh of any creature who gets too close. A thrailorn's head is obscured within their thorny hide, with only their slavering maw and needle-like teeth visible. Though they have poor vision, they have a keen sense of smell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Woodwarps are mutated monsters created when a sapient creature is flooded with unchecked energy from the Plane of Wood that they're unable to control. This rush of all-consuming planar energy scours the creature from the inside out, subsequently warping them into a monstrous humanoid-plant hybrid—an aberration possessing the physiological features of both, painfully reshaped into something dreadful to behold.</p>\n<p>A woodwarp's form and features are determined by the size of the creature they were before their transformation—thrailorns were Small, and durnoliths were Medium. Regardless of their appearance and form, woodwarps endure constant pain from the dense root network that grows inside of them, piercing bone, muscle, and internal organs. This agonizing, all-consuming pain drives woodwarps to violence, causing them to lash out at everything around them.</p>\n<p>In her quest for ultimate power, Ruzadoya Quickmane devised a ritual to purposefully funnel energy from the Plane of Wood into her followers, transforming them into either a woodwarped monstrosity or an elite woodblessed soldier known as Ruzadoya's Chosen. An elaborate wooden ritual focus carved from Idyllis, a tree from the Plane of Wood, serves as the focus for this ritual and the source of planar energy. During a woodwarp's transformation, this wooden ritual focus fuses to the body and becomes the origin point for the woodwarp's root network. Woodwarps created through such rituals are easier to control than woodwarps created by happenstance, as an experienced ritualist can imprint their will upon a woodwarp during their transformation. Such woodwarps serve Ruzadoya as hunters, sentries, and vicious shock troops.</p>\n<h2>Just A Name</h2>\n<p>While woodwarps have proper names, it's unlikely that members of the Rootweft Lodge will discover them. Instead, the woodwarps are referred to by monikers or nicknames. Thrailorns are dubbed \"thornbacks\" and durnoliths are dubbed \"batterfrills.\"</p>\n<h2>Other Woodwarps</h2>\n<p>Thrailorns and durnoliths are not the only types of woodwarps. Creatures of different sizes result in different woodwarps. Sprites, fey dragonets, jinkins, and other Tiny creatures become izifaines—headless woodwarps with fleshy wings and a sharp stinger shrouded in toxic flower petals. Centaurs, minotaurs, giants, and other Large creatures become rogoars—athletic woodwarps with muscular, elongated arms who wrestle their prey.</p>",

Green men aren't concerned with all the multifarious processes of nature like Gozreh or many other nature deities. Instead, they focus nearly all their attention on the plants of their home, only concerning themselves with animals, minerals, and the like insomuch as they affect the plants.

However, good and evil green men do exist. These individuals are far more likely to attempt to spread their influence far and wide, either for good or ill. Good green men provide succor to all that come within their home, not only to plants, providing wisdom like a nurturing parent. Evil green men, however, allow rare and dangerous plants to thrive in their domains by spreading fear and devastation to all those who might threaten plant life, though they might keep a few animals around to hunt for sport.</p>",
