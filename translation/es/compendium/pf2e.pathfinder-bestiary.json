Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Su capacidad de seguir órdenes se la otorga el cerebro humanoide inerte que flota en la cúpula que tiene por cabeza. En casos excepcionalmente raros, el cerebro usado en su creación puede conservar fragmentos de recuerdos o incluso intelecto real, lo que resulta en un gólem alquímico con su propia personalidad y objetivos.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Fabricado a partir de materiales básicos y luego animado mágicamente para que sea un poderoso guardián, el legendario gólem es un constructo viviente que obedece las órdenes de su creador sin cuestionárselas; y a menudo sigue haciéndolo años o incluso siglos después de la muerte de su amo. Existen dos métodos conocidos de animar un gólem. El método tradicional implica recolectar e implantar un alma o esencia elemental dentro de la estatua portadora recién creada, un procedimiento que resulta vil y blasfemo para quienes valoran la santidad del alma; los creadores de gólems malignos o amorales suelen decantarse por este método. La otra técnica, menos cuestionable, consiste en inyectar energía positiva en estado puro directamente a la estatua para imitar artificialmente la creación de un alma. El resultado no proporciona al gólem un alma verdadera y por lo general es un método más costoso y laborioso. Sin importar el método usado, el gólem resultante funciona igual. La fuerza motriz tan única de un gólem hace que sea susceptible a ciertas formas de magia, pero, aparte esas escasas debilidades, es inmune a la magia y difícil de dañar con las armas.</p>\n<p>Los gólems funcionan mejor en las partidas como enemigos a los que derrotar en lugar de como aliados que acompañen a los PJs en sus aventuras. El proceso de crear un gólem es lento, caro y difícil y solo los lanzadores de conjuros o artesanos de mayor talento pueden aspirar a lograr esa tarea. Aunque se dice que hay ciertos textos mágicos (denominados ‘manuales de gólems’) que ayudan a fabricar gólems, en su mayor parte la creación de un gólem debería quedar en manos del Director de juego.</p>\n<p>Los gólems tienen partes que se pueden recolectar como trofeos o componentes mágicos; su valor depende del gólem en cuestión.

Masters of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world.

Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious.

Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>",

Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin.

Barghests often make use of their shapechanging abilities to rule tribes of goblinoids or to discreetly hunt in rural areas in the guise of unnaturally intelligent wolves. They do not work well together, as each barghest wants all the kills for itself; cannibalism is the typical result of too many barghests in one small area.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Barghests are lupine fiends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago, barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests' loyalties and philosophical nature changed significantly. Today, while barghests retain their connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.</p>",

Entre los granjeros, que desprecian a estas criaturas que suelen drenar su ganado hasta dejarlo seco, se los conoce con el nombre regional de ‘estirge’. La sabiduría popular dice que la aparición de buscasangres en una región significa que el ganado está sano, pero en realidad lo que suele significar es que hay ciénagas o edificios viejos y descuidados. Desde luego, el folclore no es consuelo para un granjero al que una infestación de buscasangres ha llevado a la ruina. Pero a pesar de su estatus de parásitos, los buscasangres no son odiados en todos los pueblos. En algunos casos, los habitantes de puebluchos remotos incluso los tienen como mascotas o los usan como dudosas ‘herramientas’ medicinales para drenar fluidos indeseados o comprobar si la sangre muestra rastros de posesión por espíritus malignos. Los adoradores de los dioses de la pestilencia y los parásitos suelen tratar a los buscasangres como sagrados y permiten que se alimenten de sus cuerpos. En esas sociedades, quienes accidentalmente entregan demasiado son considerados ‘bendecidos’ por el hambriento dios del poblado.</p>\n<p>Los buscasangres parecen estar siempre hambrientos, pero no son inherentemente malignos. Es bastante fácil ahuyentarlos y prefieren retirarse rápidamente que arriesgarse a morir. Algunos aventureros cuentan que se puede asustar a estas alimañas voladoras agitando una antorcha en su dirección. Sin embargo, los buscasangres son mucho más atrevidos cuando se reúnen en gran número, pues abatir a una sola víctima puede alimentar a toda la colonia. Las colonias de buscasangres son llamadas coágulos, por motivos obvios (y desagradables). Si un buscasangre solitario encuentra una posible víctima y su coágulo está cerca, emite un ruido agudo y estridente para pedir refuerzos.</p>\n<p>La mayoría de humanoides evitan a los buscasangres, pero los boggards a veces cultivan nidos de buscasangres en el perímetro de su territorio. Estas colonias sirven para disuadir a los intrusos y los boggards a veces buscan las presas de los buscasangres y se\nllevan los pellejos o huesos de los animales que han matado. Los platos preparados a partir de buscasangres que se han alimentado de criaturas concretas son muy apreciados entre las comunidades de boggards, que no sólo se comen a los insectos, sino que\npreparan una pasta gelatinosa a partir de la sangre drenada.</p>\n<p>Los buscasangres suelen medir 1 pie (30 cm) de longitud, con la piel moteada de color marrón rojizo y el vientre amarillo. Sus cuatro alas recuerdan a las de un murciélago. Cuando se han atiborrado de sangre, quedan hinchados y de color rosa y suelen volar de forma torpe e inestable hasta terminar de digerir su comida.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Blue dragons are the sleek and poised cosmopolitans of the chromatic dragons. Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Brass dragons are whimsical tricksters who delight in humor and play. They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>",

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above-at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey. Their appearance, appetite, and iconic dorsal fin have earned the nickname \"landshark.\"</p>\n<p>A typical bulette claims a territory of approximately 500 square miles. When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory. They actively avoid contact or conflict with other members of their kind unless seeking a mate. Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time. The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt.</p>\n<p>The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast. Some sages postulate that the original inventor may have been an elf-a theory born out of little more than the curious fact that bulettes, for all their ravenous nature, seem to find elf flesh unpalatable. Unfortunately for elves who stumble into a bulette's path, bulettes are no less likely to kill them than any other intruder, simply leaving the bodies unconsumed where they fall.</p>",

For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.</p>\n<p>In some ports, bunyips have learned that delicious prizes can be had from the chum and garbage discarded by fishing boats and merchant vessels. They lurk close to the shore and carefully choose their victims, plucking them off docks and small boats. These bunyips are particularly careful to keep their true forms hidden, but this does little to dull rumors of monster-infested waters.</p>",

They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Crafty and careful hunters, their motivations, their patterns of attack, and even their societies and history are often an inscrutable jumble of contradicting reports, confused rumors, and terrifying accounts.</p>\n<p>Like many of the stranger creatures of Golarion, cloakers were originally created by the alghollthus, who bred them to spy on their Azlanti thralls. Upon the fall of the Azlanti empire, the alghollthus cast out their cloaker creations, who, in turn, fled to the lower reaches of the Darklands. Amid the vaults and twisted corridors of their new home, their attitudes-particularly regarding their apprehension toward their former masters-changed dramatically. Suspicion became paranoia, egotism, sadism, and much worse. Now, most cloakers lead solitary lives, stalking the Darklands for easy prey and delving deeper into internal horrors. Their paranoia is so great that they interact only rarely even with their own kind, encountering another cloaker only briefly to mate before flitting back to isolation.</p>\n<p>But there are exceptions. Every so often, a charismatic cloaker priest can call together a dark cabal of these creatures and other Darklands denizens to worship unspeakable ancient gods. These rare cloakers whip their acolytes and followers into a frenzy of dark rituals and heinous acts. While these cults are depraved and destructive, they rarely survive longer than their founder.</p>",

They often dress in extravagant clothes dyed with ostentatious colors and wear numerous elaborate accessories, whether in their true form or in disguise as human children, halfling merchants, or anything else that helps them blend into their targeted society.</p>\n<p>A dandasuka rakshasa is constantly haunted by a monstrous hunger that gnaws at its hyperactive body, forcing it to feed often. In combat, a dandasuka might pause to lick a bloody blade or lap at a pool of spilled blood on the floor. These creatures settle for other meat when they must, but much prefer the taste of mortal humanoid flesh. Regular offers of such victuals can keep a dandasuka loyal to anyone willing to provide frequent meals, but care must be taken in keeping a dandasuka, for many stories tell of them being overly eager to serve an adored benefactor, taking off-hand remarks too literally, and performing services of violence that were never intended.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Rakshasas are evil spirits that cloak themselves in the guises of humanoid creatures, that they might walk unseen among their prey. They embody what is taboo among most societies, and in the shape of those they seek to defile, rakshasas gorge themselves on these hideous acts. A wide range of rakshasas exist; presented below are the diminutive, sinister dandasuka rakshasa and the infamous raja rakshasa, who are the most widespread and commonly encountered of these fiends.</p>",

Indeed, the dark naga sees such ideals as spiritual expressions of an essential truth: if one can take something, that something is theirs to have. The dark naga sees other creatures as lessers worthy only of subjugation or as rivals who must be eliminated.</p>\n<p>Dark nagas dwell in remote places other creatures have forsaken, searching abandoned ruins for wealth and potent magic items. Those unlucky trespassers into a dark naga's lair typically find themselves as the naga's slaves or playthings, put to sleep with the monster's poison or incinerated by its deadly magic. Some dark nagas are more disposed toward socializing than others; in these cases, they may become wicked despots who rule over enclaves of captive or unsuspecting subjects. Subtler dark nagas, especially those who crave finer luxuries, dwell in or under the wealthy settlements and use their wiles to garner a decadent following, forming something akin to a cult with the naga as the jewelry-bedecked object of worship.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Demiliches are formed when a lich, through carelessness or by accident, loses its phylactery. As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Void energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.</p>\n<p>Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>",

Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families.</p>\n<p>Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended periods of time-even decades-to yield results.</p>\n<p>Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don't trust potential cohorts not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful infiltration.

      "publicNotes": "<p>El drakauthix es un enorme hongo que flota en las alturas de las mayores cavernas de las Tierras Oscuras, propulsado por vesículas que proyectan aire y esporas. Es un cazador voraz pero lento, que prefiere emboscar a criaturas de carne desde las alturas y usar sus apéndices con garfios para arrastrarlas hasta lo alto y alimentarse. El proceso digestivo de un drakauthix es completamente externo: se aferra a sus víctimas y su superficie recubierta de esporas se alimenta lentamente de la carne y se extiende por ella hasta que la carcasa está totalmente infestada de esporas y es descartada. En cuanto el cadáver infestado se estrella contra el suelo, explota, libera una nube de esporas y de él surgen varias crías llamadas brotesporas que inmediatamente trepan por las paredes de la cueva para pegarse al techo y empezar a crecer.</p>\n<p>Los drakauthixes demuestran una inteligencia mayor que la de la mayoría de animales depredadores y a menudo usan una especie de método simbiótico carroñero para obtener presas, similar a los métodos de caza de cienos y sabandijas de sus mismos complejos cavernarios. Cuando una criatura relativamente carente de intelecto mata una víctima, el drakauthix desciende, aferra el cadáver reciente con sus extremidades y lo arrastra hacia las alturas. Los cienos descerebrados u otras criaturas similares a quien acaba de robar su comida raramente guardan rencor y simplemente se van a por una nueva presa, dejando que el drakauthix digiera el cadáver en paz. Por supuesto, los drakauthixes no tienen reparos en ir a por presas más activas y a veces atacan a aventureros que se olvidan de mirar hacia arriba al explorar una red de cuevas misteriosas.</p>\n<p>Algunos moradores de las Tierras Oscuras, como los duergar, cazan drakauthixes para comérselos, pues tienen un sabor único con un regusto a pimienta. Las razas subterráneas también hacen tinta con los drakauthixes a base de quemar sus restos y luego moler y prensar la ceniza durante un largo periodo hasta que se forma una sustancia plateada.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>El primer proceso de modelado de carne que dominaron los drow sigue siendo a día de hoy el más conocido y el de mayor éxito: las drañas. Esta fusión del cuerpo de un drow y el de una araña gigante da lugar a un ser modelado con dimorfismo sexual y una capacidad única: la de reproducirse. Mientras que las drañas hembras tienen la parte superior del cuerpo de elegantes mujeres drow con afilados colmillos venenosos en la boca, las drañas machos tienen rostros atroces y mutados que combinan su forma humanoide y de araña; la diferenciación en apariencia es quizá un reflejo de la naturaleza matriarcal de la sociedad drow. En combate, todas las drañas son igual de peligrosas.</p>\n<p>Aunque el proceso de modelado de carne fue pensado originalmente como castigo para los drow que caían en desgracia, los considerables poderes y fortalezas obtenidos con esta horripilante transformación resultan atractivos para algunos drow y un número creciente de ciudadanos de bajo rango de las ciudades drow se presentan voluntarios para tan doloroso procedimiento. A cambio de un tiempo de servicio obligatorio (que normalmente se mide en décadas) como guardia, soldado u otro agente público, a esas drañas voluntarias luego se les permite vivir en libertad, normalmente en cavernas ubicadas en la periferia de la ciudad. La amarga verdad es que la gran mayoría de drañas no vive lo suficiente para disfrutar de esa recompensa, pues los drow tienen tendencia a explotar a sus esclavos modelados hasta que mueren o mandarlos a misiones desesperadas en las que la probabilidad de sobrevivir es muy remota.</p>\n<p>La mayoría de drañas emplea magia arcana pero también se sabe de muchas que usan magia divina y unas pocas usan magia ocultista o primigenia. Los conjuros innatos de una draña siguen siendo los mismos sin importar su tradición mágica, pero sus conjuros preparados pueden ser completamente distintos a los aquí presentados si la draña estudia una tradición distinta.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Algunas criaturas, en especial los drow, no se conforman simplemente con matar a sus enemigos. Se deleitan en la degradación total de sus adversarios a través de la horripilante técnica transformadora conocida como modelado de carne. Aunque el proceso del\nmodelado de carne no fue inventado por los drow, se cree que ellos lo perfeccionaron. Los drow torturan a sus enemigos en pozos de reactivos mágicos, reformando su carne y su psique para crear seres horribles y monstruosos. La reconstitución de la carne resultaen incontables variaciones de modelados y a continuación hay un par de ejemplos de estos horrores.</p>",

Rather than building webs of silk, ether spiders shape the raw essence of the Ethereal Plane, weaving it in complex patterns that drift through the misty void. From these ethereal nests, whole families of ether spiders can scout the adjacent Material Plane, watching for easy prey in dark or remote corners of the land of mortals. Once an ether spider has spotted a meal, it anchors its nest and waits on the Ethereal Plane for its prey to draw near. As soon as its victim is within reach, the ether spider shifts to the Material Plane, clamps its fangs onto its prey, then shifts back to the Ethereal Plane to wait as its venom works through the creature's system. Ether spiders move between the planes with ease, making them extremely dangerous to those who cannot see or attack ethereal enemies.</p>\n<p>Ether spiders are not mindless or evil-they are simply hungry. If a prospective meal can sate an ether spider's incredible appetite through other means, they might be able to bargain for their life. Ether spiders are especially interested in items, information, or allies who can help them against their enemies.</p>\n<p>As many as half a dozen ether spiders might dwell in the same ether web. Although ether spiders enjoy one another's company, they don't form the same bonds as most humanoids, and they are more likely to feast on the corpse of a fallen sibling than save one from certain doom.</p>\n<p>Ether spiders dwell in vast nests adrift in the Ghost World, where they are more likely to let down their guard. Travelers who find a floating ether spider commune should have an easier time of making peaceful contact to trade with or even befriend these strange arachnids. The nests drift on metaphysical currents and are rarely seen in the same vicinity twice. Sometimes a point of interest on the neighboring Material Plane compels them to tether their nest to an area, creating a semipermanent home, and those who learn its location can return to it repeatedly.</p>",

Rather, the first priority for most creatures during such a confrontation is escape, which is not easy to accomplish given the ettins' notorious vigilance. In this way, two heads are better than one-ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin's two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn't dream of life without the other. Much like some twins, an ettin has two individual minds who nonetheless consider the other as much a part of their life as their own self.</p>\n<p>Ettins do not resemble a single giant heritage so much as an amalgamation of several. Their tusks are thought to stem from orc ancestry, though their size and dimness suggest hill giant blood. Though they tower over goblins and hobgoblins, ettins are more than at home among tribes of these creatures and enjoy their comfortable stations as camp lookouts or troop rearguards. Their exposure to a wide variety of goblinoids and giants is evident in their language; ettins speak a pidgin tongue of Goblin, Jotun, and Orcish, and their diction is mostly good enough to get across the general meaning of their short sentences and bumbled sayings-although most interlocutors simply nod their heads while conversing with an ettin anyway. The monsters are notoriously short tempered and, despite their heightened visual perception, short sighted in matters of keeping their allies alive.</p>",

Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

While all azatas cherish freedom, each type exemplifies a particular freedom above others. Many of their kind hold strange knightly and courtly titles that defy mortal classification and shift and change with time and on different occasions rather than following a strict hierarchy. This baffles archons and other more lawful creatures who haven't had much contact with azatas.

Tienen un intelecto básico que les permite entender aklo e incluso hablarlo, pero sólo de forma ininteligible y en contadas ocasiones. En lugar de eso, lo habitual es que sus incontables bocas parloteen y balbuceen en un torrente verbal que interrumpe los procesos cognitivos de otras criaturas cercanas.</p>\n<p>Dónde, cómo y por qué se originaron los bocones barbotantes son incógnitas sin respuesta. Comparten ciertas similitudes con los mucho más poderosos shoggoths, lo que da pie a teorías de que las dos criaturas tienen un origen compartido; aunque eruditos menos compasivos sugieren que el bocón barbotante es quizá el intento de un mortal de crear algo similar a un shoggoth… pero por qué sigue siendo un misterio. Luego hay quienes creen que los bocones barbotantes fueron enviados al mundo por los dioses como castigo por una transgresión olvidada pero obviamente terrible. Los propios bocones barbotantes no parecen muy dispuestos a compartir la respuesta a esas dudas… por lo menos de forma comprensible. Hay eruditos que han desperdiciado incontables horas tratando de hallar sentido a los ruidos de los bocones barbotantes, unos estudios que ponen a los investigadores en peligro y proporcionan resultados contradictorios y confusos en el mejor de los casos.</p>\n<p>Sea cual sea su origen, los bocones barbotantes se pueden hallar por todo Golarion.

For example, a struggling weapon smith might wish for fame and skill at their craft, only to find that their best patron is a cruel and sadistic murderer who uses the weapons in bloody sprees. Or a lonely widower might have his desire granted in the form of a lost love returned to \"life\" as a vampire. Glabrezus are nothing if not creative in addressing a mortal's needs.</p>\n<p>These massive demons have enormous pincers and a pair of smaller humanoid arms sprouting from their chests, but their size belies their skill at magic, and they possess formidable innate spells. Treachery demons arise from the souls of mortals engaged in treason and deception.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend-a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin-be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery. Once formed, a demon's driving goals are twofold-the amassing of personal power, and the corruption of mortal souls to cause them to become tainted by sin.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Gold dragons are the epitome of metallic dragonkind, unrivaled in their strength as well as their wisdom. They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice.

      "publicNotes": "<p>Once a barghest has eaten enough to grow into a greater barghest, it typically seeks a method to leave the Material Plane and return to the Abyss, there joining other fiends as yet another of that plane's horrors. As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities. Some barghests grow large bat-like wings upon their transformation. Others develop toxic breath or vestigial limbs. The options detailed in the stats below represent only the tip of the proverbial iceberg for barghest mutations-feel free to use these as inspiration for coming up with new mutations of your own design.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Barghests are lupine fiends with goblinoid faces and humanoid hands. They stalk the Material Plane in search of souls to sate their demonic hunger. Eons ago, barghests dwelled in the pits of Hell and served Asmodeus, but after Lamashtu abducted and adopted the four most powerful of their kind to serve as pets (and in time, as a pantheon of hero-gods worshipped by evil goblins), barghests' loyalties and philosophical nature changed significantly. Today, while barghests retain their connection to goblinoids, they serve none but their own appetites.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Green dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",

Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>",

Atrapa dichas presas con sus fuertes brazos que se dividen a partir del codo en un par de antebrazos, lo cual le proporciona cuatro manos con garras. Estos monstruos brutales están recubiertos de pelaje negro, a menudo apelmazado por sangre y vísceras.</p>\n<p>Aunque los gugs tienen una apariencia bestial, disponen de un intelecto agudo y cruel. Establecen sus guaridas muy por debajo de la tierra, pero a veces salen a cazar a la superficie durante noches oscuras, ya sea en solitario o en grupos pequeños. Como tienen apetitos voraces, la mayoría de gugs consumen al momento a las criaturas que atrapan, pero algunos prefieren llevarse a sus víctimas y retirarse bajo tierra, dejando sólo un hedor residual y extrañas huellas de garras. Los prisioneros son arrastrados hasta rancias madrigueras marcadas con runas desconocidas y sacrificados a los viles dioses de la sangre, las tinieblas y las pesadillas que adoran los gugs. Hay rumores sobre ciudades gugs carentes de luz y fabricadas a partir de bloques de piedra titánicos en las entrañas de la tierra, donde poderosos líderes gugs predican sus viles doctrinas ante muchedumbres aullantes.</p>\n<p>Los gugs tienen una extraña relación con los guls, que parece provenir de su origen compartido en un lejano mundo subterráneo. Los gugs viven atemorizados por los guls, a pesar de superarlos en fuerza y tamaño; sin embargo, este extraño miedo no se aplica a los ghasts, a los que consumen con la misma voracidad que al resto de criaturas. Los gugs suelen medir unos 16 pies (4,8 m) de altura y pesar 2.000 libras (900 kg), aunque tienen un caminar extraño y grácil que no se corresponde con su tamaño inmenso. Su paso ligero y su capacidad de escurrirse por espacios pequeños hace que los gugs se usen como hombres del saco en cuentos sobre extrañas desapariciones o sangrientas masacres.</p>\n<p>Algunos gugs especialmente sanguinarios obtienen poderes atroces como dones de sus ignotos patrones. Estos monstruos se conocen como prodigios, nunca tienen menos de nivel 12 y obtienen varios conjuros ocultistas innatos. Aunque la combinación de conjuros concreta varía de un prodigio a otro, normalmente esos poderes otorgan invisibilidad, el poder de manipular la roca, o el de invocar energías destructivas sobre la carne de los seres vivos.</p>",

Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don't rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren't destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others-they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons' war against imbalance-particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.</p>\n<p>Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the \"Convergence.\" At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons-but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How-or if-this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.</p>",

Few who witness the quelaunt linger on its alien looks for long though, as the most pressing concern quickly becomes the invasion of their minds, as the quelaunt sows doubt, sorrow, and rage. This monstrosity not only delights in the negative emotions of its prey, but feeds on them, gaining strength and sustenance from their dismay. For the quelaunt, no act is too terrible or cruel to inflict on its victims, since the more a creature suffers, the more the quelaunt feasts.</p>\n<p>Quelaunts are known to associate with other aberrant horrors, including brain collectors and other creatures associated with the Dominion of the Black. However, the more prevalent theory paints them as more alien-perhaps invasive beings from another dimension of pure thought and feeling-and claims that in their natural state they have no physical bodies at all. Few dare speculate further; the only known autopsy of a quelaunt resulted in the researcher's suicide just days afterward and all the notes were mysteriously destroyed. Whatever secrets there are to be unlocked in the anatomy of these bizarre monsters are apparently important enough to warrant great protection from quelaunts, even after death.</p>",

Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",

Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims die before even knowing what attacked them.</p>\n<p>Those who survive the worm's initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh-all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz's internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz's intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons.

When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the first suspects.</p>\n<p>Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves \"sahuagin\" but have wholly embraced their enemies' name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.</p>\n<p>Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from the ranks. Every pup is given a fair chance, however, and even the lowest-born sea devil can strive for the rank of commander, general, or perhaps even king or queen. Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest, most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own. The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling attempts at their positions via manufactured blood feuds and wars against their numerous enemies ashore and underwater.</p>",

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.</p>\n<p>Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and inflict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.</p>",

Shoggoths exist, yet they tend keep to the deepest of ocean trenches or the most remote of caverns and ruins, emerging to spread chaos and destruction in their slimy wakes.</p>\n<p>The first shoggoths were created by an alien species to serve as mindless beasts of burden. Their vast bulk, incredible strength, and amorphous nature made them useful slave labor, and their ability to spontaneously form whatever new eyes, mouths, limbs, and other organs they might need made them incredibly versatile. Eventually, the shoggoths developed enough intelligence to rebel against their masters, and now they lurk, patient but potent, in the lightless deeps.</p>\n<p>A shoggoth has goals and methods unknowable to humanoid beings. They remember their eons of servitude and, compared to their mysterious masters, humans, elves, dwarves and other intelligent beings are mere specks which crawl upon the surface of the world, indistinguishable from animals. When a shoggoth rolls its immense, hideous body over a band of explorers, engulfing them in a gelatinous press of flesh and gnawing teeth, it is not so much evil as uncaring.</p>\n<p>Shoggoths can become the object of worship for humanoid cults dedicated to chaos and entropy. The shoggoth does not respond to this worship, but it can be counted on to consume any hapless victim the cult can capture and sacrifice to it. Rumors of shoggoths that have developed even greater intellects are, one would hope, just that, for the damage a shoggoth capable of reasoning could wreak upon a world is unsettling to say the least.</p>",

Beautiful, graceful, and truly gargantuan, the simurgh resembles nothing so much as a massive multicolored bird with the head of an equally enormous and regal lupine. Simurghs act as intermediaries in world-threatening conflicts, serving as agents of good deities or vigilantes who spread their own brand of justice, typically by obliterating or banishing evil extraplanar beings.</p>\n<p>Simurghs can live for thousands of years, and because these ancient beings are so rare many doubt their existence. But they are very real, as those who have been aided by a simurgh can enthusiastically attest. A simurgh does not show itself often, but when it does, it is typically in response to a truly grave threat, such as the incursion of an undead army or the rampage of some truly epic monster. Simurghs are nothing if not paragons of righteousness, and goodly heroes can hardly find a better ally in their quest to vanquish evil than a simurgh.</p>",

At the zenith of alghollthu power, ulat-kinis formed massive legions and enjoyed significant power over other species. When the alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or along isolated coastlines. Few remember their own species' name, instead using the epithet their foes gave them: \"skum.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Stone golems are slow and steady constructs typically carved from marble or granite. They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the golems' functionality.</p>\n<p>Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size-most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth's body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.</p>\n<p>Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth's creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune's close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas's many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth's description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>The most feral and least intelligent of all the chromatic dragons, white dragons are brutish, predatory, and chiefly motivated by self-preservation. Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>",
