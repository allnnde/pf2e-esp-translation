Whatever their specific reasons for joining the organization, armigers share the Hellknights' dedication to spreading the rule of law across Golarion. This commitment sees them serving in a variety of missions, whether it be rooting out bandits and crooks, imprisoning smugglers and black marketeers, or investigating rumors of sedition. While frontier villagers sometimes welcome the assurance of safety that the Hellknights bring, free thinkers and historians chafe at the restrictions on movement and expression that armigers enforce.</p>\n<p>Although armigers are not yet full knights, those who underestimate them have made a grievous error. Once ordered to take a position or eliminate a foe, an armiger is unerring in fulfilling their order. During battle, they wade eagerly into the fray, targeting servants of chaotic gods and those they observe using underhanded tactics.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Firm believers in enforcing the law at any cost, Hellknights are often based in Cheliax, but they travel to all across Golarion to enforce their ideals of order. This rigid viewpoint and intolerance for dissent means that PCs can just as easily find villains in these Hellknights as they can allies; an agent of the Hellknight Order of the Chain might aid the PCs in subduing a vile and violent criminal, or might hunt down the PCs due to mild infractions of unjust laws. The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions.

Tyrants and slavers are their favorite targets, and many a greedy colonizer or trafficker in flesh has been sent to the bottom of the sea after the captain liberated their cargo.

Many call on the power of the fickle goddess Besmara to strengthen their crew in battle and sanctify each shipboard raid. As at home in water as on deck, a privateer captain will gladly leap into the sea to pursue a foe or rescue a fallen crewmate. Though the privateer captain might run under a false flag or attempt to deceive a foe before battle, they generally honor agreements to surrender and make a point to keep their word, particularly when dealing with other Firebrands.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Wherever oppression or an opportunity for daring adventure can be found, the Firebrands can be found chasing after.

The charming scoundrel presented here could easily be a low level freedom fighter or foil for the PCs, or might serve as crew for the privateer captain.

The diligence and power of the Tempest-Sun Mages has ensured that no invading force has ever come within 20 miles of the university they defend.</p>\n<p>When the Tempest-Sun Mages are not defending the academy itself or accompanying envoys or teachers to distant locales, they use their mastery of arcane and primal magic to keep watch in the surrounding city and beyond, keeping an eye on the balance of power throughout the whole of the Mwangi Expanse. This magical intelligence often allows them to foresee threats to the academy or any nearby towns before such threats can even organize and approach.</p>\n<p>While Tempest-Sun Mages generally prefer to disable or incapacitate enemies, and readily call upon on their companions from the Uzunjati to reason with foes when possible, they do not hesitate to unleash lethal force against dangerous or implacable enemies, often taking to the air and raining down elemental fury.

The virtuous defender could be a member of a knightly squad or a recruiter seeking those willing to risk their lives to save Avistan from a terrible peril. The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse.

When not rallying troops to battle against their sworn foe or protecting villages from undead incursions, these knights travel the Inner Sea in hopes of recruiting other righteous souls to fight against the undead hordes.</p>\n<p>Many Shining Sentinels are servants of good deities, such as Iomedae; in battle, they turn their god-given powers against their foes. These virtuous warriors put the safety of their companions before their own and often hold defensive positions to protect their allies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Though the nation of Lastwall is shattered and its leaders have fled, the courage of those who once defended its shining walls remains strong. The Knights of Lastwall are found in places of great calamity, escorting civilians and beating back the undead. Should the PCs ever venture into a crisis zone, they may likely as not see the Knights of Lastwall there as well, be they forming an armored wall to defend the innocent or creeping through deathly wastelands where even the bravest know mortal fear. Unless the PCs are evil or unwitting dupes of Tar-Baphon's agents, the Whispering Way, these knights mostly serve as precious allies in realms where friendly faces are rare. The virtuous defender could be a member of a knightly squad or a recruiter seeking those willing to risk their lives to save Avistan from a terrible peril. The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse. Such cunning but virtuous souls might request help leading people to safety, act as a guide through unknown territory, or offer valuable advice and information about dangerous creatures or traps the PCs might risk encountering.</p>",
