(The attitudes referenced in the effects below are summarized in the Changing Attitudes section at the bottom)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target gives you the information you seek or agrees to follow your directives so long as they aren't likely to harm the target in any way. The target continues to comply for an amount of time determined by the GM but not exceeding 1 day, at which point the target becomes unfriendly (if it wasn't already unfriendly or hostile). However, the target is too scared of you to retaliateâ€”at least in the short term.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but once the target becomes unfriendly, they might decide to act against youâ€”for example, by reporting you to the authorities or assisting your enemies.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target doesn't do what you say, and if they were not already unfriendly or hostile, they become unfriendly.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The target refuses to comply, becomes hostile if they weren't already, and is temporarily immune to your Coercion for at least 1 week.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Changing Attitudes</h2>\n<p>Your influence on NPCs is measured with a set of attitudes that reflect how they view your character. These are only a brief summary of a creature's disposition. The GM will supply additional nuance based on the history and beliefs of the characters you're interacting with, and their attitudes can change in accordance with the story. The attitudes are detailed in the Conditions Appendix and are summarized here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Helpful:</strong> Willing to help you and responds favorably to your requests.</li>\n<li><strong>Friendly:</strong> Has a good attitude toward you, but won't necessarily stick their neck out to help you.</li>\n<li><strong>Indifferent:</strong> Doesn't care about you either way. (Most NPCs start out indifferent.)</li>\n<li><strong>Unfriendly:</strong> Dislikes you and doesn't want to help you.</li>\n<li><strong>Hostile:</strong> Actively works against youâ€”and might attack you just because of their dislike.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No one can ever change the attitude of a player character with these skills. You can roleplay interactions with player characters, and even use Diplomacy results if the player wants a mechanical sense of how convincing or charming a character is, but players make the ultimate decisions about how their characters respond.</p>"

The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level.</p>\n<p>Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ending or Interrupting Tasks</h2>\n<p>When a task you're doing is complete, or if you stop in the middle of one, you normally have to find a new task if you want to keep Earning Income. For instance, if you quit your job working at the docks, you'll need to find another place of employment instead of picking up where you left off. This usually takes 1 day or more of downtime looking for leads on new jobs.</p>\n<p>However, you might pause a task due to an adventure or event that wouldn't prevent you from returning to the old job later. The GM might decide that you can pick up where you left off, assuming the task hasn't been completed by others in your absence. Whether you roll a new skill check when you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking, if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you can't try for a better one by pausing to do something else. If your statistics changed during the breakâ€”usually because you leveled up while adventuringâ€”you can attempt a new check.</p>\n</section>"

You can't perform other downtime activities while retraining.</p>\n<p>Retraining usually requires you to spend time learning from a teacher, whether that entails physical training, studying at a library, or falling into shared magical trances. Your GM determines whether you can get proper training or whether something can be retrained at all. In some cases, you'll have to pay your instructor.</p>\n<p>Some abilities can be difficult or impossible to retrain (for instance, a sorcerer can retrain their bloodline only in extraordinary circumstances).</p>\n<p>When retraining, you generally can't make choices you couldn't make when you selected the original option. For instance, you can't exchange a 2nd-level skill feat for a 4th-level one, or for one that requires prerequisites you didn't meet at the time you took the original feat. If you don't remember whether you met the prerequisites at the time, ask your GM to make the call. If you cease to meet the prerequisites for an ability due to retraining, you can't use that ability. You might need to retrain several abilities in sequence in order to get all the abilities you want.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Feats</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your feats. Remove the old feat and replace it with another of the same type. For example, you could swap a skill feat for another skill feat, but not for a wizard feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skills</h2>\n<p>You can spend a week of downtime retraining to swap out one of your skill increases. Reduce your proficiency rank in the skill losing its increase by one step and increase your proficiency rank in another skill by one step. The new proficiency rank has to be equal to or lower than the proficiency rank you traded away. For instance, if your bard is a master in Performance and Stealth, and an expert in Occultism, you could reduce the character's proficiency in Stealth to expert and become a master in Occultism, but you couldn't reassign that skill increase to become legendary in Performance. Keep track of your level when you reassign skill increases; the level at which your skill proficiencies changed can influence your ability to retrain feats with skill prerequisites.</p>\n<p>You can also spend a week to retrain an initial trained skill you gained during character creation.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Class Features</h2>\n<p>You can change a class feature that required a choice, making a different choice instead.
