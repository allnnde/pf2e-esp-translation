These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets' bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain unconscious and can't be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.</p>\n<p>A target's astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they're carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item's duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession.

While in the Astral Plane, the other targets are unable to navigate without you, and if they become separated from you, they must wait for your return or Dismiss their own astral forms. When the ritual ends, the targets' astral forms vanish.</p>\n<p>A target's astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as a conduit and safety line; if it is severed, the target's astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic} being cast on a target's physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target's astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual's primary check.

It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a clearing in a forest, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else one can imagine. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.</p>\n<p>Demiplanes have environmental conditions as appropriate for the Material Plane, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level, as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.</p>\n<p>When you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane.

Either way, you trap it inside a gem, jar, bottle, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions. Destroying the container kills the target rather than freeing it. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also transmutation magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Oubliette (10th rank only)</strong> You entomb the target in a state of suspended animation deep beneath the surface of the ground and out of tune with reality so that it can't be reached by any means. You also prevent divinations from revealing the location where the <em>imprisonment</em> occurred. Powerful magic such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.6dDtGIUerazSHIOu]{Wish} can reveal the location of the imprisonment, but even such magic can't free the target from the oubliette; only a 10th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4ddJSjC9Zz5DX0oG]{Freedom} ritual can do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Prison</strong> You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.</li>\n<li><strong>Slumber (sleep effect)</strong> You put the creature into an eternal sleep. It ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target-whether romantically, filially, or otherwise-frees it from the slumber. This form of <em>imprisonment</em> is also enchantment magic.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal Stasis</strong> You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of <em>imprisonment</em>, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9HpwDN4MYQJnW0LG]{Dispel Magic} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.o6YCGx4lycsYpww4]{Haste} spell.

Instead, they each take @Damage[9d6[fire]] damage as they each bake in their clay shells (@Check[type:fortitude|dc:24|basic:true] save) before the failed ritual snuffs out the flames and cracks open their partially fired clay casings. The ritual can be attempted again after 24 hours have passed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> As long as the Tan Sugi stands tall above Kugaptee's grave (as it does, after the climax of the previous adventure) and Willowshore's Eternal Lantern is lit in both the mindscape and the living world, you can draw upon the artifact's power to transmigrate the entire Willowshore mindscape. This more complex version of the ritual has a cast time of 5 days and affects the entire mindscape. Furthermore, this ritual can only be attempted after the first day of the new year in the mindscape (the 72nd day of this adventure), as it also draws upon that milestone societal event to work its magic. Any attempt to cast this version of transmigrate before either of those two requirements are fulfilled causes the casting to fail as it begins, before any checks are attempted or its costs are paid. This version of the ritual must be cast near Willowshore's Eternal Lantern, which is located on the southern side of Dawnstep Bridge. As with the 4th-rank version of transmigrate, this ritual requires the creation of a kiln within 30 feet of the Eternal Lantern, within which a scale model of the town of Willowshore must be crafted from clay. On the first day of casting, the kiln itself is prepared and anointed with aromatic oils. On the second day, a platform of sakaki wood slats is built in the kiln and then anointed with additional oils. On the third day, the town of Willowshore is sculpted on the platform from clay. On the fourth day, heron feathers and sticks of incense are placed in the sculpture's still drying clay; the sticks of incense are lit and continually replaced through the day as they burn. Finally, on the fifth day, the kiln is lit and the sculpture is fired. The next day, as the people of Willowshore awaken from the ritual, its effects become apparent. See \"Concluding the Adventure\" on page 61 and Chapter 1 of the next adventure for more details.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The Willowshore mindscape transmigrates wholly into the living world. The full extent of what transmigrates depends on how many Preparation Points remain unspent at the end of this adventure, but the Critical Success at this ritual grants the party an additional 12 Preparation Points to determine this success, as detailed at the start of the next adventure.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, without bonus Preparation Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The ritual fails, but a new attempt can be made after 24 hours have passed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but the failed ritual also spreads waves of despair through town, causing food stores to rot away and buildings to take damage as if affected by years of neglect. The party loses 12 of their remaining Preparation Points, deducted as they see fit from Hope Points, Food Points, and Security Points. If the party can't deduct the full 12 points from their remaining Preparation Points, reduce all points to 0. Their next attempt to cast the ritual at 5th-rank takes a –2 status penalty to its checks.</p>",
