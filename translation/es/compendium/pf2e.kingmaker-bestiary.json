      "publicNotes": "<p>Centaurs are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o'-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>",

      "languages": "telepathy 300 feet; tongues",
      "publicNotes": "<p>The Lantern King is one of the Eldest-a pantheon of demigods whose rule over the First World is one of capriciousness that can be at times playful, enigmatic, bizarre, or even downright mean. For the most part, the Lantern King's plots and shenanigans tilt toward the cruel, and while he's long been a master at riding the proverbial razor's edge between mischief and outright sadism (if only by conserving his cruelest plans for those who invite that cruelty by being cruel themselves, as in the case of Nyrissa), his latest actions have certainly drawn the notice of the other Eldest. As such, they have largely distanced themselves from him, and as a result of this, any defeat the PCs deal to him in this adventure goes not only unpunished by the Lantern King's demigod siblings but will even be enforced, in a manner of speaking, by the other Eldest so that the Lantern King won't seek continued revenge against the PCs for their victories. Whether or not this also serves to teach the capricious eldest a lesson to temper his need for mischief with occasional bouts of patience and even mercy, only time can tell.</p>\n<p>The Lantern King's direct interactions with the PCs in this campaign are via an avatar-a powerful proxy created from himself to rule over the Lantern Kingdom. While this avatar isn't as powerful as the Lantern King himself, it remains the single most dangerous foe the party faces in Kingmaker. As a demigod, the Lantern King is an even more dangerous foe, equivalent in power to a 29th-level creature and possessing abilities beyond the scope of the core experience in the <em>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</em>. Some of these abilities, such as the power to manipulate reality, to create powerful artifacts like the <em>Apology</em>, and to build entire demiplane realms like the Hunting Dream or the Lantern Kingdom, manifest during the course of the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> not as rules content but as story elements the PCs will need to endure-see Chapter 11 of this book for more details.</p>\n<p>In combat, the Lantern King's avatar uses flight to remain out of melee for the first several rounds of combat, relying upon his spells to soften up the party before using his Strikes against them. He's fond of taking actions that disrupt, torment, or mock the PCs rather than those specifically tailored to maximize damage. For example, he often uses Playful Switch to swap a flying PC in the air with one who's on the ground and can't fly, or he uses illusions to create false foes or locations that play off of previous failures or embarrassments the PCs may have endured during the campaign itself. By playing the Lantern King's avatar in battle as more of a trickster than a cold-blooded killer, you'll not only enforce his legendary personality upon your players, but you'll also give their characters a bit more of a fighting chance against him in battle. He prefers to hold @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.MLNeD5sAunV0E23j]{Primal Phenomenon} in reserve to recover from an unwanted condition or situation, and as he realizes the PCs are dangerous foes, he abandons \"playful tactics\" for more serious or tactical decisions aimed toward defeating the party rather than toying with them.</p>\n<p>While the Lantern King faces no lasting inconvenience if his avatar is slain, the sting of such a defeat is enough to compel the avatar to back down and ask for a truce if the PCs reduce him to fewer than 75 Hit Points. If the PCs agree to a truce, the avatar compliments their prowess and promises to turn his attentions away from the Stolen Lands. Furthermore, he agrees to any additional terms the PCs ask for, provided they are within his ability to grant. This includes restoring Nyrissa's place and realm to the First World (although he cannot provide further information about her lost lover) and unmaking <em>Briar</em> to restore her capacity to love.</p>",

Huge, tusk-like fangs descend from an athach's upper jaw and prop their mouth open, leaking long strands of viscous drool that is itself is a toxic venom and coats the athach's fangs.</p>\n<p>Athachs despise civilization almost as much as they despise their own kind, and they delight in committing sadistic acts and terrorizing victims. An athach does not keep a traditional territory of their own, but rather wanders the hinterlands of settled territories until they find a suitably easy settlement of smaller humanoids to target. Once the athach has chosen their target, the giant establishes a hidden lair in a location like an abandoned farmhouse or cave, and from there they launch their reign of torment. After a few weeks of harassing, capturing, and torturing victims, the athach bores of their games. The giant then goes on a final rampage, destroying every dwelling and eating every creature they can find. Sometimes, the giant allows a survivor or two to escape, forcing these terrified victims to spend the rest of their lives spreading word of the athach's fearsomeness.</p>",

While corpses preserved in this manner can certainly rise from the mire as bog mummies as the result of a curse by fell powers or the directed influence of a necromancer, the vast majority of them animate from a seething need for vengeance or to pursue some dire agenda left unfinished at the time of death-often because the creature was slain or otherwise betrayed. The nature of tthis emotional tie to life and the emotional power of the deceased compel unlife beyond death, while the preservative qualities of the bog within which the body was disposed of does the rest.</p>\n<p>Although most bog mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill their dark yearnings with general violence.

They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>",

For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range.

Rumors of fetches that are reflections of entities from other planes persist, but none of these tales speak of fetches that duplicate anything other than a sapient source. A fetch can manifest spontaneously when a powerful creature undergoes a significant emotional event or dies, either while on the First World or while in an area significantly influenced by the First World, but one can also be created by significant forces like the Eldest in order to torment and vex those who have annoyed them. While a fetch manifests from a soul's \"reflection,\" and as such bears a striking resemblance to that creature's appearance in life, a fetch has no true memories of its own. It keeps fragments of false remembrances from its source as if it experienced them in a half-remembered dream-which ensure the fetch is enraged by and jealous of its source.</p>\n<p>A fetch is similar in appearance to the creature whose soul spawned it, save that it often displays fey-like features such as pointed ears, plantlike elements, or supernatural grace. A fetch who seeks to impersonate a stillliving source must disguise these features, and takes care to manifest its fetch weapon as one known to be wielded by its target.</p>\n<p>When a fetch dies, it and its manifested items fades away into a bloom of plant life, its soul instantly recycled into the First World, leaving behind a patch of weeds and thorny flowers roughly in the shape they held in mockery while alive.</p>",

Folklore holds that, much like for the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk's physiology lends any credence to this claim.</p>\n<p>A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying \"as slow as a well-fed basilisk.\" Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed.</p>\n<p>An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they're agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks. What causes these unusual congregations of basilisk activity is unknown.</p>\n<p>For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk's stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young. Some legends suggest that a basilisk's blood can transmute common stones into other material, but this is likely a case of witnesses misinterpreting the magical restoration of previously petrified creatures or body parts.</p>",

These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike.</p>\n<p>Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called \"wings\" for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor's edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty-traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs.

More and more of the townsfolk gather to hear him talk and, as the days wear on, he builds a wellspring of support among the disaffected settlers in the town. Every decision the PCs make has a winner and a loser, and Grigori is gifted at shifting focus to the losers in these decisions and riling them up. Whether it is appealing to the citizens who didn't get what they wanted when the PCs built a new city block, to spinning a narrative that paints a recent event in the most horrid light for those for whom the outcome was a negative, a properly played Grigori should become a constant barb in the players' side and one of the most memorable villains they encounter. Grigori takes great pains to avoid breaking any of the PCs' laws so that they have no legal justification to arrest him other than that they want to silence him.</p>\n<p>Grigori is more than just an itinerant storyteller; he's a spy and agent provocateur sent by King Irovetti, the Lord of Pitax, to spread chaos and dissent in the town with the aim of overthrowing the PCs and possibly paving the way for Pitax to annex the settlement. In order to cover his tracks and retain plausible deniability, Irovetti used several layers of agents to hire Grigori; as far as the bard knows, he was hired to cause trouble in this fledgling town by agents from Fort Drelev to the west.</p>",

Water orms might lie in a silty lake bed for years, their elusiveness only contributing to their mythical reputation. When a pet or child goes missing near a lake, rumors might hold that the local water orm is responsible, leading to folk tales that caution residents against venturing out alone near the water.</p>\n<p>While most water orms are described as serpentine or long-necked reptiles, others look similar to bizarrely elongated seals or whales, impossibly large sea horses, or long-necked creatures with paddles resembling those of elasmosauruses.</p>",

The ahuizotl's macabre habit of feeding on a victim's eyes, fingernails, and teeth leaves the corpses of its kills uniquely mutilated. Some say the creatures consider these body parts delicacies, while others insist ahuizotls collect them as tribute to a powerful but unknown entity. The fact that an ahuizotl does not eat the actual flesh of its victims, instead depositing their savaged and waterlogged corpses in locations where the remains are sure to be found by friends or family, points to a third and perhaps more likely possibility-the ahuizotl simply enjoys using its violent dietary quirks to spread fear and despair.</p>\n<p>An ahuizotl walks on all fours, but its hands are capable of manipulating simple tools and other objects. Ahuizotls have roughly mustelid features and an extra membrane covering their eyes, giving their eyes a dull color suggestive of cataracts and somewhat blunting the creature's vision. Yet despite their bestial appearance, ahuizotls are nearly as intelligent as the average human, and wiser than most. Although they don't form societies of their own, they have been known to ally with violent cults or conclaves of monsters, and even to found small shrines and temples to sinister deities. The cult of Charon, the horseman of Death, is particularly popular among certain ahuizotls, who look forward to an afterlife spent wallowing in the waters of the River Styx.</p>",

Beyond organizing the push into the Stolen Lands and her desire to foster a new ally to the south, she hopes some day to found additional dueling schools beyond Brevoy's borders where the Aldori style can be taught-a pursuit that not all of her peers equally approve of.</p>\n<p>Characters who earn Jamandi's trust and support can unlock access to the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.vx5FGEG34AxI2dow.JournalEntryPage.cBBwTnJrVmvaRMYq]{Aldori Duelist} Archetype at your option.</p>",

      "hpDetails": "regeneration 20 (deactivated by vorpal weapons)",
      "publicNotes": "<p>Few beasts have inspired as many legends, poems, songs, and myths in as many cultures, as this bizarre draconic creature. The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.</p>\n<p>Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.</p>\n<p>Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization-the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better!</p>\n<p>The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it-nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.</p>\n<p>Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.</p>\n<p>Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.</p>\n<p>Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.</p>\n<p>Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike. A slithy jabberwock's whiffling aura is activated whenever it swims, makes a tail Strike, or Burbles.</p>",

They know their history and value its integrity and privacy-if younger ancestries like humanity aren't interested in learning from lizardfolk empires dating back to before the first human knocked two rocks together to make their first campfire, that's fine with them.</p>\n<p>The word 'lizardfolk' is an excellent example of humanity's narrow-sighted view of this culture. The name of their people is 'iruxi', but these reptilian humanoids have patiently and good-naturedly accepted the name 'lizardfolk' as a variant, and they generally resist urges to call humans and other mammalians similarly derivative names in return. Iruxis dwell and thrive in all tropical and temperate biomes, but they are most at home in swamplands, coastal regions, and riverlands, for they are talented swimmers, and fish and aquatic plants make up a large part of their preferred diets.</p>",

As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern's resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.</p>\n<p>Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern's pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ravenous, bestial, and driven by instinct-drakes are primitive draconic monsters who bear a fraction of the terrifying might of their larger cousins but little (if any) of the cunning. While they're weaker, slower, and less inclined toward reason than dragons, drakes are nonetheless a menace to creatures and settlements around them. Their propensity for forming raiding parties-small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"-makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.</p>\n<p>Drakes share a number of physical characteristics that unite them as one species despite their wide variety of habitats and abilities. For example, drakes lack forearms, leaving them only their formidable jaws and thick-scaled tails with which to attack if engaged at melee range. Most drakes would rather avoid close combat, however, preferring to use their breath weapons to wreak havoc in wide swaths from comfortable distances while flying overhead. Finally, all drakes have small reservoirs of their ancestral draconic power that they can tap into to perform incredible feats of speed.</p>",

They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.</p>\n<p>Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.</p>",

Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question. Examples of components that can be harvested from golems are listed in the sidebars.</p>",

The lovers inspired each other to increasing acts of audacity, and it wasn't long before Nyrissa began to think of herself as the newest of the Eldest and proclaimed this to any who would listen, beginning to build her own nation in the First World. Another of the Eldest, the Lantern King, saw opportunity for mayhem here. He spread his influence among his fellow demigods, and before long, several among the Eldest opposed Nyrissa's claim and took steps to challenge her. First, they sent a jabberwock to destroy her, but Nyrissa defeated it and used its blood to create lesser jabberwocks under her own control. Then they attempted to rally a thousand powerful fey against her, but Nyrissa convinced those fey to serve her instead in return for a place in her domain. Finally, the Eldest exiled Count Ranalc to the Shadow Plane for helping to cause the problem in the first place. Suddenly, Nyrissa found herself without an ally among the Eldest. Having expended much of her energy and resources to defeat the jabberwock and recruit the thousand, she knew that she had lost the war and surrendered, apologizing for her acts.</p>\n<p>The Lantern King decided that Nyrissa's apology would suffice only for the jabberwock's death; for her other deeds, he demanded a further punishment- Nyrissa's capacity to love. Without love, the Lantern King argued to the other Eldest, Nyrissa would not be able to sway another of them to her side. However, if she could replace the \"thousand fey breaths\" she stole from the First World with a thousand stolen nations, they would accept her apology for her other actions and restore her capacity to love. Faced with no real option, Nyrissa agreed. She was allowed to keep her domain, now known as Thousandbreaths, but it was carved off to form its own demiplane to serve as a sort of prison. Her love was taken from her and transformed into the sword Briar, which was then entrusted to the Lantern King for safekeeping. He gifted Nyrissa with a chalice he called the Apology, an artifact capable of transforming Material Plane kingdoms she conquered into motes of sand. Once the Apology held a thousand motes of sand, those lands would be absorbed into the First World, Nyrissa would be forgiven, and love would be restored to her.</p>\n<p>The matter settled, the Eldest quickly moved on with their own inscrutable agendas. Yet while they eventually forget about what they'd done to Nyrissa, the nymph herself did not. She grew more and more obsessed with her loss of love-or perhaps it was the loss of love that caused her to grow more violent and obsessed. In her early attempts to discover the location of <em>Briar</em>, she received the visions that would come to haunt her-that <em>Briar</em> would be returned to her, but only as an instrument of her own death.</p>\n<p>Now she has but one kingdom left to claim: the new kingdom risen in the Stolen Lands. With the War of the River Kings over and one kingdom a victor, the time is right for the final grain to be added to the <em>Apology</em>. That this will destroy a significant region on Golarion is irrelevant to the loveless nymph; in her obsession, she fails to see that this act may be the very thing that drives her enemies from to slay her as in the vision.</p>",

Persistent stories claim the viper vine can lure prey into its clutches by swaying with a hypnotic motion, but this effect is in fact created by this invisible, odorless pollen cloud.</p>\n<p>Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots. It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.</p>\n<p>The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses.

A medusa may seek out powerful magic items, use divination magic to discover secret knowledge and unlock forbidden power, or infiltrate a society to beguile influential politicians. Their ability to worm their way into powerful organizations makes them natural leaders of criminal outfits and thieves' guilds, and their interest in magical phenomena leads some to pursue careers as oracles who offer to help adventurers find what they seek-for a price. Of course, if wit and deception proves insufficient, a medusa can always simply turn rivals into ornate stone decorations with little more than a glare.</p>\n<p>Exceptionally agile and surprisingly hardy, a medusa rarely backs down from a conflict even when cornered. Many adventurers who thought themselves readied to resist the effects of a medusa's gaze have nevertheless fallen to a medusa, as these creatures are also often deadly archers able to riddle their foes with venom-coated arrows from a distance. Still, a medusa may barter for their life if no alternatives remain, and the secrets carried by these powerful villains often make it more than worth sparing the monster's life.</p>",

Their diet includes arctic animals such as elk, but a hungry remorhaz readily devours anything it can catch and kill. It commonly lurks beneath ice or snow and ambushes prey with a sudden upward strike. Many victims die before even knowing what attacked them.</p>\n<p>Those who survive the worm's initial onslaught must face not only its deadly jaws, but also its hideously hot body. This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh-all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz's internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz's intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons.

Whereas elasmosauruses are mundane creatures of animalistic intelligence, water orms are magical beings with near-humanoid intelligence and a curious fascination with mortals, and they seem to delight in confounding onlookers.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind. Shambler elders are few and far between and may possess a wide array of abilities; some can cast primal spells, others can empathically call upon the aid of other shamblers in the area, and still others wield awesome powers over electricity.</p>\n<p>Other types of shamblers exist, including those composed not of plant matter but fungal growth. These creatures, known as \"spore mounds,\" discharge clouds of toxic spores from their bodies when struck in combat. In semiarid deserts, shambler-like plants called tanglethorns dwell amid sagebrush and rock formations; they resemble bunches of tumbleweeds and cacti and inflict deep, bloody lacerations with their attacks.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Malevolent balls of colored light, will-o'-wisps haunt lonely marshes and forests where they lure unsuspecting travelers into danger. Will-o'-wisps can vary the color and illumination they shed, and delight in mimicking bobbing lanterns or distant fires to draw lost or disoriented travelers off of safe trails. They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn't, in fact, leading them to safety. Even invisible, however, a will-o'-wisp rarely ventures far from its target, as it feasts upon the panic and dread felt by its victims.</p>\n<p>Beneath its glow, a will-o'-wisp's body is a spongy ball approximately 1 foot in diameter and weighing less than 5 pounds. Although most will-o'-wisps are merely translucent, featureless orbs, gaining definition only in the shifting illumination they create, a few have dark mottling that makes them resemble a skull when viewed closely. Will-o'-wisps have no need for mundane nourishment, and in fact lack the ability to consume matter of any kind; they find all the sustenance they need in the terror of nearby creatures. For this reason, they like to work alongside undead that produce terror in their victims. Will-o'-wisps are long-lived, if not effectively immortal, and they have good memories. A cowed or defeated will-o'-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.</p>\n<p>Will-o'-wisps inhabit desolate swamps and forests and are generally active at twilight and after dark. They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o'-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they're lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster. Because of this, will-o'-wisps try to vary the ways in which they induce terror in their prey, to ensure they don't tire of certain flavors of fear.</p>",

In times of grave danger, all the groves in a region may gather for a great months-long meeting to plan and, eventually, act upon a threat.</p>\n<p>The typical arboreal regent is 30 feet tall, has a trunk 2 feet in diameter, and weighs 4,500 pounds.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Arboreals are guardians of the forest and representatives of the trees. As long-lived as the woods they watch over, arboreals consider themselves parents and shepherds of trees rather than their gardeners. Consequently, while arboreals tend to be slow and methodical, they are terrifyingly swift when forced to fight in defense of the woods. Though they rarely seek out the companionship of short-lived folk-even elves are fugacious in the eyes of arboreals-and have an inherent distrust of change, arboreals have been known to tolerate those who seek to learn from their long-winded, rambling monologues, especially if such pupils also express a desire to protect the timberlands. Against those who threaten their realm, such as loggers eager to harvest lumber or settlers aiming to establish croplands or a town, arboreals' wrath is unwavering and devastating. Perhaps ironically, arboreals are gifted at tearing down what others build-a trait that serves vengeful members of their kind well.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Legendarily massive raptors capable of carrying off elephants as prey, rocs are typically about 30 feet long from beak to tail and have a wingspan of 80 feet or more. While their beaks are hooked to rip flesh from bone, their hunting strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds' meals. Rocs, for the most part, don't mind these creatures, which sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc's food.</p>\n<p>Rocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.</p>\n<p>Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.</p>",

The gnome grew up in Pitax and, of all that nation's rulers he'd observed, Irovetti impressed him the most with his admiration of art and style. That the king wasn't very supportive of art styles and pursuits he didn't enjoy never even registered in Tartuccio's mind, as his tastes were so similar.</p>\n<p>And so Tartuccio set into motion plans to catch the king's attention, so as to become first his student, then his trusted advisor, and in time his replacement. He even went as far as to seek out, research, and learn a potent magical technique that allowed him to change shape, intending to use this newfound supernatural power to adjust his appearance to be something more pleasing to the king's eye when the time came to petition to become his student. Tartuccio spent months scouring the rumor mills for opportunities, and when he heard of Lady Jamandi's call for heroes to expand into the Stolen Lands, he saw his chance. Tartuccio gathered his supplies and headed east.</p>\n<p>Once the events of Chapter 1 play out, Tartuccio is unsettled by the amount of competition he faces. He travels into the Stolen Lands where he's heard rumors of a kobold settlement that's ripe for the taking, uses his ability to change shape to assume the appearance of an unusual purple kobold, and work the Sootscales into a sort of private army he intends on using to wrest control of the PCs' nation just as they get started. His hopes of using the PCs' kingdom as a stepping-stone are threatened by the untimely conflict with the mitflits of the Old Sycamore, as detailed in Chapter 2.</p>",

These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters-namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin- they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well-mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous-but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.</p>",

Instead of drawing sustenance from light and soil, scythe trees gorge themselves on the flesh, blood, and bone of sapient creatures. Nothing is more delectable to scythe trees than a kind-hearted gnome or an altruistic dryad who believes that a scythe tree can be redeemed. The screams and whimpers of these victims are music to these cruel plants and add an extra dimension of flavor to the meal.</p>\n<p>Scythe trees are solitary creatures by nature, and their size and power mean that they don't need to compete for food with other carnivorous plants. Once food sources dwindle in an area, scythe trees move on to another location. When a scythe tree dwells in a location for many months or years, it leaves traces of its bark and roots in the soil. Over time, these blood-nourished fragments might grow into a new scythe tree, but the progenitor will most likely have already moved on to new hunting grounds long before the new scythe tree reaches maturity.</p>\n<p>Scythe trees appear as dead or dying deciduous trees with long, twisted branches that end in scythe-like blades. These carnivorous plants have dark-brown bark that is nearly black near the bottom of the trunk and rusty brown leaves that remain attached year-round. Scythe trees' disturbing mouths remain closed when not eating, appearing as a jagged gash on the trunk. When scythe trees deign to speak, their voices are rough, deep, and mocking, particularly when discussing arboreals, whom scythe trees universally find to be insufferable and worthy of little more than being hacked to pieces.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>Some trolls have learned the skills necessary to survive well beyond the typical life expectancy for their kind and rally others to follow their lead. These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters-namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin- they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well-mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous-but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.</p>",

      "publicNotes": "<p>At the height of his power well over 10,000 years ago, the original Vordakai was among the most powerful necromancers of the land. When this cyclops tyrant was defeated during the chaos following Earthfall, one of his apprentices claimed his name as well as his greatest treasure, the <em>Oculus of Abaddon</em>. Though he had been the least of the necromancer's apprentices, the new Vordakai was nevertheless a powerful wizard, but it would take more than power to claim the true Vordakai's mantle. Betrayed by followers of the original leader who refused to serve him, the new Vordakai was sealed into his own tomb, and over the passage of eons, the cyclops lich atrophied.</p>\n<p>Although much weakened today, Vordakai remains a dangerous opponent who can devastate a poorly prepared party on his own. Don't be afraid to play Vordakai as arrogant creature-he has existed for longer than most creatures on Golarion, after all, and if he makes arrogant mistakes (such as neglecting to cast spells defensively or provoking Attacks of Opportunity), that not only gives the PCs a chance to survive but also helps to establish the ancient lich as both overconfident and a bit careless from his long period of quiescence. Keep in mind that Vordakai is the most powerful foe the PCs have encountered in the <em>Kingmaker Adventure Path</em> thus far, and in defeating him, they will accomplish something truly legendary.</p>\n<p>If Vordakai has the chance to prepare for battle before combat, he takes 3 rounds to cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SwUiVavHKMWG7t5K]{Truespeech}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Fr58LDSrbndgld9n]{Resist Energy} (choosing an energy type he knows the PCs favor as a result of watching them via his familiar), and then @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.j8vIoIEWElvpwkcI]{Mirror Image} just before entering battle. Finally, he activates @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.uqlxMQQeSGWEVjki]{Truesight} using the <em>Oculus of Abaddon</em> before entering combat (doing so in the first round of a fight if instead he's caught by surprise by the PCs).</p>\n<p>Once combat begins, Vordakai starts by casting @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P]{Dominate} on the party's strongest healer; if successful, he commands the healer to his side to defend him by attacking anyone who attacks the lich in melee. On subsequent rounds, Vordakai uses ranged magic against the party, casting @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fd31tAHSSGXyOxW6]{Vampiric Exsanguination} as soon as he's reduced to 100 Hit Points or fewer. When facing only one or two foes, he prefers to attack with Consume Memories followed by a hand Strike, opting to save his spells for an emergency.</p>\n<p>The greatest diminishment of Vordakai's power is represented through the loss of his soul cage-the magical item he initially used to trap his own soul and enable his transformation into a lich in the first place. He cannot create a replacement as long as he remains atrophied, but his arrogance works against him here. Only if he's reduced below 20 Hit Points does he realize that the PCs have a very good chance to defeat him, and if he survives long enough to take a turn after this realization, he casts his 5th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8]{Translocate} to flee to area C5 of his tomb. If he's able to escape in this way, he'll wait for a few days before returning to his tomb, infuriated if the PCs have released his prisoners and robbed him blind. At this point, Vordakai can become a recurring villain in your campaign!</p>",
