The people of Alkenstar typically find conventional arms sufficient for battling creatures who wander out of the Mana Wastes, but recent increases in activity from the fleshforges of Nex and the necromantic chambers of Geb have spurred the people of the city into a flurry of defensive innovations. Created by an experimental collaboration between the city's gunsmiths and clockwork inventors, the clockwork cannoneer provides exceptional mobile firepower. Two cannon-arms swing at the sides of the 15-foot-tall automaton, and its body contains a hopper of cannonballs that are replenished by engineers when the creature is wound up for duty. Triple-walled reinforcement on the cannoneer's black-powder reservoirs provides ample protection from the accidental explosions and backfires that often troubled early prototypes of the finely engineered machine. The current design combines the long-range capabilities of field artillery with the stopping power of a firedrake against engaged enemies, and its heat-tempered gear assembly minimizes warping that might cause slipping, grinding, or shaking.</p>\n<p>While reports from living artillery members serving alongside clockwork cannoneers complain of blisters, smoke inhalation, and singed eyebrows, the Grand Duchy's chief clockwork machinists have assured the city's leadership that the constructs function well within safety parameters. The clockwork cannoneer's self-sufficient construction frees crews to see to those battlefield tasks that can, for the moment, only be conducted by sentient beings.</p>\n<p>Intelligence reports from Quantium and Absalom indicate that attempts to replicate the clockwork cannoneer's design have been spectacularly unsuccessful.</p>",

They took a small gem and wrote a word of power upon it. They gave it eyes so it could see and legs so it could walk, and made it wise. These creatures are known as kaseshi by scholars who have encountered them, though their true name—the one that brought them into being—is likely considerably more powerful.</p>\n<p>Each kasesh bears a single word of power on their emerald body, from which they draw their mind and their magic. A kasesh with the word \"Steel\" or \"Flame\" is a single-minded creature, though it encompasses all possible permutations of meaning that the word possesses. A kasesh named \"Home\" or \"Sorrow\" has a far more complex psyche, and rumor claims that Elder Architect Oblosk of Nex bears the word \"Memory.\" Unsurprisingly, many scholars are highly interested in the words on the kaseshi; unlike Thassilonian rune magic, no one has managed to decode or make use of the language of the Vault Builders yet.</p>\n<p>The kasesh in the stat block bears the word \"Stone,\" but other kaseshi will have their own magics.

The size and number of their horns vary. Kashrishi communities are generally quite welcoming to others, enjoying the conversation and unique auras of every new stranger. However, chaotic environments can overwhelm and overstimulate kashrishi not yet adept at filtering psychic energies, leaving some with limited tolerance for extensive social interaction with strangers and requiring they take periods of time to refocus after socializing.

Nor did curses provide ratajin with skin tones of all hues within the color spectrum. Instead, these residual curses have given each ratajin distinctive geometric markings all across their body. Every ratajin also experiences a cursed twist on their senses, altering how they view and interact with the world around them. Some ratajin visualize the world in shifted, indescribable color spectra. For others, sounds physically manifest as feelings on their skin. Haunting melodies of past actions might whisper in the wind behind one ratajin, while another can be awake only during hours devoid of sunlight.</p>\n<p>While particular curse manifestations are passed along family lines, each ratajin's worldview can offer a unique perspective. Ratajin tend to be receptive to new ideas, making them well-suited to tackle complex situations. They often prefer to focus on difficult problems, working without rest until they reach a solution. What satisfies the definition of a worthy pursuit varies with individual ratajin, from tinkering with new applications of technology to uncovering secrets of centuries-old magical tomes. Their intellectual approach to problems can make ratajin especially useful in situations requiring delicate words, and their quick thinking serves them well as adventurers when the time comes for action. These same characteristics also make them capable merchants and scholars.</p>\n<p>Earning a ratajin's trust can prove difficult. Their large-scale communities often collaborate to devise clever solutions that ensure equitable treatment among people, but each community varies greatly due to the different needs of the inhabitants. Outsiders who require too much help too quickly might cause a ratajin to withdraw, believing their guest incapable of adjusting to life's many hurdles. Poorly chosen words of pity or meaningless sympathy toward the nature of a ratajin's unique sensory experience can also cause lingering resentment.</p>",

Skinskitters, named for their fluid, erratic movements, scavenge the city for leavings of fleshy waste. They prefer discreet, non-violent ways of procuring these biological materials and shy from combat, seemingly possessed of a nervous temperament. Nexian fleshforgers quip this is entirely reasonable, as skinskitters are little more than nervous systems wrapped in dying skin. Nexian guards who actually have to hunt these fleshforged pests aren't quite as jocular; confronted by the oddly childlike pleas of these cornered puddles of flesh, hair, and eyes, many recruits simply choose to leave the city watch.</p>\n<p>On occasion, curious scholars or soldiers have questioned why skinskitters pursue organic tissue, and whether this is a simple instinct or in pursuit of a grander purpose. Most fleshforgers assume that skinskitters consume organic matter to repair themselves in a process similar to eating, and give the matter no further thought, showing no more interest in the creatures than a smith might show in a bead of melted slag. The most paranoid Nexians claim that skinskitters are attempting to build something out of their collections of cast-off skin, perhaps even reconstructing themselves into fleshforged conformers. There is no recorded evidence of this ever occurring, however—if the creatures have any awareness at all, it's more likely that skinskitters are driven by the basest of instincts to better themselves through the same methods used in their creation but lack the understanding and self-direction to ever succeed.</p>",

Ugvashi first arrived in the Impossible Lands onboard the Thousand and One ships of Maharajah Khiben-Sald, alongside peafowl, giant squirrels, and other fauna from Vudra. In the modern day, ugvashi are such a recognized sight that many people forget they aren't a native species. Though some feral populations exist, mainly on the island of Jalmeray, the hostile environs of Nex and the Mana Wastes mean ugvashi mainly appear in domestic settings, usually as working beasts among the Nearic halflings of western Nex.</p>\n<p>Though ugvashi are mostly harmless, they're somewhat more dangerous than their smaller cousins, causing a stir when reckless citizens attempt to pet the creatures. Ugvashi scales are razor sharp, and their large and blunted digging claws can be deadly due to their size. People who attempt to steal the animals or ride them without training often receive moderate cuts for their trouble. However, ugvashi are generally curious and very friendly, and more than one visitor or wilderness explorer has found a baby ugvashi toddling after them and pawing at their boots.</p>\n<p>Nearic halflings also paint their ugvashi with distinctive warding patterns and sigils, some of which are actually effective and provide a surprise for opportunistic thieves or predators. Though due consideration is spent on protecting an ugvashi's cargo, the animals themselves have proven to be tempting targets as well, especially for their meat. With blighted landscapes making animal husbandry impractical and magical pollution leaving local seafood with a distinct aftertaste, a number of Nexian and Mana Wastes peoples have developed a taste for ugvashi. Since the animals lack an aggressive temperament, it often falls to their caretakers to discourage such predations through whatever means necessary.</p>\n<p>Ugvashi shed their scales each winter, allowing for the plates to be collected safely and turned into quality armor and other pieces of craftwork. Nearic halflings rarely trade or sell these items, however, out of fear that they might lead to more people trying to steal their ugvashi.</p>",
